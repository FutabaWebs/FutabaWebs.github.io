These two techniques are your bread and butter and are what you’ll be going for during a lot of pentests, CTF challenges, etc, regardless of how you go about it: SQL injection, OS command injection, remote file inclusion, etc. It’s really all the same. If you’ve ever noticed, during a lot of big hacks, one of the most common things that ALWAYS happens is that the attackers somehow discover a way to RCE the system, allowing them to gain backdoor access and formulate something called a “botnet”, allowing them to deliver various payloads and command and control the network. Before I dive into this, as always I want to get you up to speed on some terminology so that you understand what’s going on. Let’s go over the main TCP/IP handshake so you understand the overall process. </br> </br> <strong style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;"> <im> Disclaimer</im></strong> </br> </br> As always, personal disclaimer, any and all information for this is strictly for educational purposes and I do not condone any form of illegal activity, nor am I responsible for anything you should use this information for. DO NOT pen-test on anyone's network unless it is your own, or you have permission to do so. Now, let's begin! </p> </br> </br> <h4 id = "tcp" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the TCP/IP 3-way-hand-shake? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>First, In order for you to fully understand how all of this works, we need to go over the TCP/IP 3-way-handshake, as well as how sockets/ports work, and how all of this ties in together. This carries over on a fundamental level and gets you into the habit of understanding how network data communications function on a logical and "visual" level. </p> <p></p> <p>Let’s start off with the classic Web application example. When you visit a web application, you begin a process that is known as the TCP/IP handshake, which occurs in 3 steps via flags set in ICMP data packets: SYN, where the client is initiating a connection to the server, SYN/ACK, where the server responds, acknowledging the session being inquired, followed by ACK, which is the client side sends to finalize and begin the connection to the server. All of this also applies to the basic principles of how systems talk to each other over a network, which is what makes up the internet as a whole as it’s just a larger scale of that. </p> </br> </br> <h4 id = "backdoor" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a BackDoor? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Backdoors, also known as RAT, remote access Trojan, is the form of interconnecting two systems together maliciously in order to send data and or control a system. It can vary depending on what it’s needed for. In most cases it’s used as a way to botnet, command and control, and RCE a system. Stuff like a meterpreter shell in metasploit is a common example that is often used. It’s also known as a reverse shell exploit which is the same concept.</p> <p></p> <p>As the name would suggest, often it’s used via Trojan malware methods, or “companion” viruses that trick the user into clicking on it with stuff like “fake adds” or “false program icons” on your computer screen. Once you click on it, you’ve given the attacker access to your system. </p> </br> </br> <h4 id = "rce" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is RCE? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>RCE, remote code execution, is when you are able to remotely control a system via shell code commands Shell code commands are terminal commands, things like bash and powershell for example. For hackers, this can be achieved in a variety of different ways. SQL injection for example can achieve this via the “system” command feature that comes packaged with SQL. SQL allows you to use this to send shell code commands to the main system. This means that if you are able to pwn a server via SQL injection you also have the potential to RCE it in the process. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "botnet" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a Botnet? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Botnetting is the overall process of infecting a variety of different systems on a network, controlling them like bots/zombies in order to further one’s access to the network, compromising the IT infrastructure further. This takes place during the maintaining access step of the pentesting methodology, and is where you establish ways to stay connected to a compromised network. This goes into something that is known as command in control. </p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "cmc" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is command and control? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Command and control is when you control, as the botmaster of the botnet, all the systems on the network and do regular checks on them to see if they are still alive. Think of it as you “blueteaming” for your “botnet”. For example, you can do stuff like beacons, which sends data packets to check if the system is still alive, or even install logs so that you get regular status updates on them. </p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "clientserver" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the difference between Client and Server? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>VERY CRUCIAL, and this is something that will play a vital role in your understanding of the difference between client and server. A client connects and sends data to the server, and a server “listens”. What do I mean by that? Servers have open ports that are in a listening state that wait for incoming connections and data from clients, and then handles and responds to them accordingly. The best way to think of this would be in the sense of ordering from an actual server via a restaurant menu. You put in an order, and then the server responds by delivering it to you. </p> <p></p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/WomensHistoryMonth2025" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

Now, let's begin! </p> </br> </br> <h4 id = "premise" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Premise 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>In order to walk you through how to perform the technique, lets go over a few things first like: ARP, pingsweep, and spoofing. ARP, address resolution protocol, is what NSlookup is, but for MAC addresses. ARP translates the corresponding MAC address back to the IP of the system it pertained to. Pingsweeping is the process of pinging a series of IP addresses via a network range to check for ICMP responses. No response typically indicates a system is not up, a response indicates the system is up. There are a variety of different scan types, each with unique return results. Spoofing is the concept of masquerading as another entity, whether it be a machine, such as a spoofed MAC address, or a person for social engineering exploits, such as a spoofed ID badge for example. Now that we have the basics covered out of the way, lets begin!</p> <p></p> <p>As always, any and all advanced versions of this article with a video guide if given will be for PAID patreon members only!!</p> </br> </br> <h4 id = "arp" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is ARP Poisoning? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>How does ARP poisoning work? Essentially you are masquerading your IP and MAC address on the internal network as another system in order to receive any network traffic data intended for it. When you communicate on the network, whether it be internally (the local network) or externally (a web server), the default gateway, your router, handles the communication for you and routes it on your behalf. When you receive a response it also handles and forwards that information to you as well. If you masquerade as another system on the network, it's essentially going to send you a copy of the return information from the victim as well. In the process, since you are also on that same system on the network, you'll also be able to see any outgoing network traffic from the victim itself and receive a copy of that as well. This means that if any of those communications are insecure, such as HTTP for example, you'll be able to see any and all data in plain text format. If the victim sent over any POST HTTP request data for example, you will be able to see any credentials they sent over to authenticate to a web server. This methodology is what is also known as a form of a man in the middle attack exploit. A Man in the Middle attack is when you intercept a communication for one or more parties involved and either steal or forward that data, manipulating it, as if you were the original sender, unsuspected to said parties involved.</p> </br> </br> <h4 id = "subnetting" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Subnetting? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>You might be asking yourself what is a subnet? Subnets are essentially networks that have been fragmented into smaller sub networks, hence subnetting. Each subnet is assigned a unique "subnet mask", the "/24" that you see here, that allows you to identify each subnet. Each subnet has it's own pool of IP addresses that can be assigned to members of that particular subnet. This allows for segmentation practices that prevent stuff like single point of failures, which are essentially monolithic based infrastructures that nest everything into one place. For network security purposes, when you do this you make it HARD for attackers to find everything, decreasing your attack surface, securing your systems greatly. With subnetting it's also possible to control which subnets can talk to each other, which is the main reason we begin a main hunt for them via the route and traceroute commands.</p> </br> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br> </br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/ARP_Poisoning" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

This is also going to dive into complex topics like: port forwarding, router exploitation, the routersploit framework, the metasploit framework, as well as how the internet works under the hood. I'm not going to directly tap into a camera feed live as that's illegal (even if it's a public cam for a park), but I am going to show you how to talk to specific ports using an IP address, whether it be in numeral format or alphabetical format. It's the same process you'll be using to tap into camera feeds should you find an open port. </br> </br> <strong> <im> Disclaimer</im></strong> </br> </br> As always, personal disclaimer, any and all information for this is strictly for educational purposes and I do not condone any form of illegal activity, nor am I responsible for anything you should use this information for. DO NOT pen-test on anyone's network unless it is your own, or you have permission to do so. Now, let's begin! </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "premise" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Premise 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>For this demonstration, since we'll be using metasploit for it, you're going to need a Shodan premium membership to get a lifetime API key(s). Sadly, Shodan now requires you to be a premium member if you wish to use the API freely. </p> <p></p> <p>You can still query searches on the site if you are looking for something and tap into feeds via GUI, but you won't have access to the full features of the core API if you wish to craft your own exploits with them via metasploit and your own code for example.</p> <p></p> <p>Link to <a href = "https://shodan.io/" style = "text-decoration: none;">Shodan</a></p> <p></p> <p>Like always, before we dive into the actual exploit, let's touch up on a bit of terminology and major concepts so that you understand how the overall process works. Wouldn't be a good article without that.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "api" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is an API? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>You've probably heard this term a lot, and probably need a bit of clarification on what this is. An API (Application programming interface) is essentially the core biological functions that make up a computer program. In most cases nowadays it's used in context with "automation" software for web applications, stuff like the "Shodan API" for example, that have core integrated functions that allow you to query information about IoT devices on the web. Another example of an API, would be a kernel, which pertains to the core functions that make up an operating system, and dictates how hardware and software interact with each other, allowing you to control the system. </p> <p></p> <p>Another good example would be the Windows32 API, that hackers and researchers use for stuff like DLL and Code injections to hook and hijack Windows system processes. They can also use it for little pranks like preventing you from opening your CD Drive, or shutting off your monitor by broadcasting a system command to all handles on the main system, shutting it off and on as they please. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "shodan" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the Shodan API? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The Shodan API is an OSINT tool that is used to track and gather information about various IoT gateway devices (routers), services hosted on them, as well as their corresponding IP's that are connected to the internet. This allows you to gain insight and exploit various services hosted on them and tap into things like: CCTV surveillance systems, home security systems, as well as file sharing services, SSH services, and of course, WEB APPLICATION services. You can also exploit any vulnerabilities that are in the firmware of the router itself, allowing you to pwn it and compromise the internal network.</p> <p></p> <p>Fun fact, when you are talking to a web server, you aren't actually talking to the main system itself directly, you are talking to the router that is hosting the service on behalf of it, indirectly. This also comes into play when you are port scanning with NMAP. When you scan with NMAP, you're actually scanning the router that is hosting many services on behalf of other systems on the internal network, or a singular one if that's the case.</p> <p></p> <p>As we know, the internet is made up of various communication devices, routers, that interconnect to one another, allowing end users to exchange data, access services like web applications (web sites), and communicate over the internet. All of this is possible through a technique known as port forwarding, that allows internal networks to safely communicate with each other. The internet wouldn't be possible without it, and without it, internal networks and highly sensitive information would be highly exposed and easily compromised.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "router" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a Router? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A router is a form of network communication device that is used to host a network, forward communications to and from the network via DNS, domain name server, as well as assign IP addresses to systems that are on the local network. The router is also known as the default gateway.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "dns" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is DNS? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>DNS, Domain name server, hosted on port 53, is what allows you to query, as well as translate the alphabetical address of a website into something that the machine can understand, numeral format, routing you to your destination. Alphabetical names are used because they are a lot easier for us to remember.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "dhcp" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is DHCP? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>DHCP, dynamic host configuration protocol, is what is used to automatically assign IP addresses to host systems on the network, otherwise systems would have to statically assign themselves as one that falls within the network range. If this isn't set properly it can cause issues such as you being unable to access the internet, even though it says you have internet.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/CCTVHacking" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

SQL injection exploits invalid user input, input that isn't properly validated when being handled to the server side from the client side when the end user performs a query to the server: logins, searches, etc. This allows you to take advantage of the input you send to manipulate the server-side back-end to retrieve additional data that isn't intended for you. This allows you to access stuff like: additional information from the main database table you are linked to, additional database tables, and additional functions and or features of the back-end of the database that you are talking to such as system command features that allow you to pivot and hijack the system further for OS command injection exploits. You can even manipulate the very privileges that are set for you and upgrade yourself to admin if you wanted to either via OS command injection if system commands are enabled on the SQL server, or via the usage of SQL queries that you can use to edit your information in the system. The possibilities are endless and are only limited based on the scope of your imagination. If you are wondering what OS command injection exploits are, it's essentially where you inject shell-code commands like bash and power-shell to the server side end to control the system directly. The overall premise of injection methods is to exploit the processes and features of the server side you are talking to in order to control it. This requires you to do a bit of recon on how the server works in order to understand what weak points to look for. We'll eventually cover how to search for injection types a system might be vulnerable to.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "tcp" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is TCP/IP? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>But first, In order for you to fully understand how SQL injection works, we need to go over the TCP/IP 3-way-handshake. This carries over on a fundamental level and gets you into the habit of understanding how network data communications function on a logical and "visual" level. SQL injection is often hard due to a lot of people unable to "visualize" how the process works. Visualization is KEY in tech, especially Cyber Security.</p> <p></p> <p>When you visit a web application, you begin a process that is known as the TCP/IP handshake, which occurs in 3 steps via flags set in ICMP data packets: SYN, where the client is initiating a connection to the server, SYN/ACK, where the server responds, acknowledging the session being inquired, followed by ACK, which the client sends to finalize and begin the connection to the server. SQL queries follow a similar order: you input data into the parameter of a web application, and then that information is processed into a structured query, and then sent to the server side for processing on the back-end, in which the server responds back to you and you acknowledge it.</p> <p></p> <p>A good place to get a visual demonstration of what I'm talking about in regards to SQL injection can be found here at this link.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "tcp" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is TCP/IP? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>But first, In order for you to fully understand how SQL injection works, we need to go over the TCP/IP 3-way-handshake.

The client side is going to be integrated with Arduino, where it will will write its own code live and connect back to the server, whereas the server side, the python script, is going to sit in a listening state on the system, waiting for the client to connect to it so it can be fed instructions from the client side to control the system. Traditionally you always want to have the server sitting on the victim system so that you can connect and interact with it, but nowadays making your back-doors peer to peer is actually best because it allows your setup to be more versatile. For safety purposes, it's just going to connect back and that's it, nothing else! The real version that is unsafe to use stays with me. </p> <p></p> <p>Sadly, this is one of those projects that you NEED to have the right equipment for to pull off, but you can still follow along the 2 demonstration videos here.

Before I answer that question, I first need to explain to you what FDE(Full Disk Encryption) is. FDE is basically stuff like Bitlocker, where it enumerates the file system and encrypts data on the system in order to prevent data theft. In this case, it’s used for defensive purposes. BUT, what if I told you, it could be used maliciously? That’s what Ransomware is. It's a form of crypto malware that uses FDE to maliciously enumerate and encrypt file system data, holding it hostage, with the crypto keys left in the hands of the attacker, forcing the victim to pay a ransom in order to retrieve the keys to decrypt the data. The real data is excavated off the system in the process with the encrypted version remaining on the system. </p> <p></p> <p>Now you might be asking yourself, how do hackers create such complex and intricate malware? It must be so complex and time consuming to write right? Well... it's actually not that hard to write. All you're really doing is combining basic file disk enumeration tactics with either asymmetric or symmetric encryption methods, and some other things to spice it up a bit. I've actually prepared a test sample for today's study, as well as a demonstration video to show you how the code works. </p> <p></p> <p>Link to the main the demonstration video can be found <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh15ZOUWVcg" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>.</p> <p></p> <p>Link to the main Code can be found <a href = "https://github.com/RoyMBull/Python-Pen-Testing-Tools/blob/main/Python%20PenTesting%20Tools/Ransomeware.py" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>.

What is "Key Stretching"? Key stretching allows us to create longer & more complex crypto keys of a smaller size. This makes the crypto key much harder to deduce via cipher text analysis attacks, as well as allow max computational performance. Typically the larger the key, the longer it takes to encrypt/decrypt. We’re also going to add in the main os/os.sys modules to send shell code commands to the main system, as well as create any directories and pivot the system for enumeration. </p> <p></p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br></br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/WhatIsRansomeWare" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

It's such an exact copy that you literally cannot tell the difference. The only difference you'll notice is that your "sessions" don't seem to quite be there. What do I mean by that? Ever opened a browser in private mode and realized you had to log back into all of your stuff? That's what I'm talking about, except it doesn't have the little incognito icon or any indicators you are used to seeing that would give it away, or at least NOT anymore. If the attacker is smart, then they can locate where cookies and saved data are stored onto the system, and then integrate it into this, BUT, that would defeat the purpose of having you re-enter them in again manually so they can exploit you. </p> <p></p> <p>Even still this form of exploit will trick you just the same. It even has the exact settings and pages, and features as the original, because it IS the original, technically. This allows you to steal credentials and other forms of sensitive information such as cookies for example from end user browser sessions. </p> <p></p> <p>The most dangerous part about this exploit is that:</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 One, it's custom and can go beyond the typical scope of just phishing data from unsuspecting end users, and </p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Two, it takes advantage of the fact you ALWAYS, have your browser open and that you are constantly clicking away at those little keystrokes of yours. This means you can get two for one and install all sorts of malware, run background processes, and even install a keylogger on the system and send data to a remote server you have to log end user credentials. It can get even more scary if you can replicate a screen watch feature in the meterpreter shell to watch the end users screen as they type. This allows you to bypass stuff like MFA, where you can see the EXACT token information being sent. </p> <p></p> <p>For this project you are going to need something that is known as a "chromium" driver, since we are going to be working with Google Chrome for this exploit. This driver, along with the selenium module has come A LONG WAY. It originally ONLY displayed the chromium browser which was a dead give away, but now, it displays the REAL thing, so there is nothing that gives it away if you manage to spoof the chrome signature and place it on the end user system.</p> <p></p> <p>Link to <a href = "https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads" style = "text-decoration: none;">Chromium Driver</a> </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "chromium" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a Chromium Driver? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The Chromium driver is what we are going to be using to mimic the chrome browser that is installed on your system, along with a module in python that is called "selenium", which allows you to call up a series of web drivers: chrome, Firefox, etc etc, and launch the real thing, even with a default page. It’s most commonly used for web application development across all resolutions for all browsers.</p> <p></p> <p>This is combined with Selenium which is a module in python that allows you to develop test case scenarios for browser integration, for stuff like add on's and extensions, or, if you are the devs, it allows you to test for new in house main features before they are added to the browser. </p> <p></p> <p>In the right hand’s, it’s harmless, BUT, in the right hands it can do a lot of damage. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "physical" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a Physical Hack? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A physical hack is a scenario where the attacker has physical access to the system, and can perform stuff like: inserting a keylogger dongle into systems to log end user keystrokes, installing back-doors and malware, taking advantage of admin access and other trusted systems and services on the network to “live off the land”, as well as bypass security further by disabling firewall systems that might block backdoor access so the attacker can maintain access, which can allow them to further do stuff like: excavate data off the network, further extend their level of access to various other sub-networks and sub domains that might belong to the infrastructure, all while being able to go undetected.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "connection" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is  the connection between a Physical hack and Social Engineering? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Social engineering allows you to manipulate people and gain access to the system physically, followed up by a physical hack that allows you to physically gain and maintain access This sets you up to potentially have backdoor access that allows you to tap back into the system undetected and exploit the system as you see fit. This allows you to bypass stuff that you normally wouldn’t be able to if it were only from a digital landscape. Some things can only be done physically due to the level of complexities that might be in place for a system infrastructure.</p> <p></p> <p>This is a common tactic that is used , whether it be as a pen-tester that is testing the security in an infrastructure, or as a threat actor that is trying to leverage the system for their own personal gain. They go hand in hand.</p> </br></br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/ManInTheBrowserExploit" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

We are also going to discuss online anonymity, and how to setup and configure TOR so you can be "truly" anonymous.</p> <p></p> <p>In order to discuss this I need to go over the 3 layers of the internet: The surface web, deep web, and dark web.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "surface" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the Surface Web? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The surface web is what we use on a regular day to day basis: work memes, YouTube, etc. It's where the least of the internet is to be explored.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "deep" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the Deep Web? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The deep web, which is to not be confused for the Dark web, is where various information archives that aren’t typically available on the surface web can be found. This is where most data breach information is typically leaked, and is also where you can find the "hidden wiki" which is what you need in order to find and access dark web pages</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "dark" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the Dark Web? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The dark web is the internet without any makeup, and is where true levels of anonymity and cyber criminal activity lurk. This is the least safe part of the internet to browse and if you are not careful you could be traced and put yourself as well as others you might live with at risk. A lot of human trafficking operations, organized crime, hackers for hire (black hats), and other crazy stuff goes on here.</p> <p></p> <p>For the sake of anonymity and security links to the "onion" sites are typically hidden and hard to find, and or available on "hidden wiki's" from the deep web. In order to access the Dark Web you'll need a special browser called "Tor"</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "tor" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How Does TOR Onion Protocol Work? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The TOR Onion protocol is what's used to connect to dark web, one of the 3 layers of the internet, and is where most illegal activity and transactions occur. TOR operates by forwarding and handling end user data communications, proxy chaining them through dedicated TOR onion servers in order to spoof the end users</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "usetor" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How to use TOR? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>If you would like to learn how to use TOR, check out my video here on how to set that all up for you</p> <p></p> <p><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkGqiIE38Ws" style = "text-decoration: none;">How To Setup Tor</a></p> <p></p> <p>I also have a custom script that installs the TOR program as well as the browser and allows you to easily set all of that up.

For as long as any and all software are man made, there will exist vulnerabilities that allow you to exploit and bypass any form of anonymous protocol in place. You can make it hard to crack, but eventually it's going to get hacked.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "episode1" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Mr.Robot Episode 1 “eps1.0_hellofriend[.]mov” 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>During episode 1 of Mr.Robot, Elliot confronts a coffee shop owner named “Ron”, who runs a TOR server that serves child pornography content on it. The coffee shop is a masquerade to hide his servers in plain sight since it’s hosted securely on his internal network via gigabit internet, which he also makes available to customers to put on a good cover front.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "oninonserver" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Why were the Ron’s Onion servers hosted on his internal network? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Ron hosted the servers internally on his own network in order to preserve his anonymity. This keeps it out of the sight of the law enforcement and viewable only to the specific audience that he caters it to.</p> <p></p> <p>In order for one to maintain anonymity when hosting a [.]Onion server on the dark web it is CRUCIAL for it to be hosted on one's own PRIVATE servers, NOT a public domain, where it can easily be found and compromised. </p> <p></p> <p>The URL link to access the site needs to also be "VIP", where it's essentially hidden in areas of the deep web, while also being given to a select few via various means: WhatsApp, Telegram, hidden Wiki Pages, etc.</p> <p></p> <p>The reason the pages need to be hidden is so that it stays off the ranges of the law enforcement, A.K.A the FBI, which typically is responsible for seizing and shutting down illegal operations on the dark web.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "privateserver" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How to Host a PRIVATE web Server? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>In order to host your own [.]Onion server you need to understand what port forwarding is. This is crucial and is how Ron was able to host his own TOR servers private on his internal network. Let's dive into what port forwarding is.</p> <p></p> <p>Port forwarding allows you to map internal IP's/ports on a network to an external gateway interface, your router. Here's how the process works. You essentially map an internal IP address and port number from a local system on your network to one of the available ports on your router, so that it's facing the internet. This is going to map the service to the public IP address assigned to the router via the ISP, as well as the port we just set for it. This allows the service to be discoverable by internal and external network devices, meaning if you wanted to host your own website from the comfort of your own home, you could, as well as a variety of different services. Be mindful when you set this, the ports don't have to be the same, meaning you can mismatch them if you want to.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "majorflaw" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">TOR's Major Flaw and how a Ron got hacked? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>So the biggest question is, how was Elliot able to bypass Tor's security and hack Ron’s TOR server if they were truly anonymous? Well, the answer is quite simple, he wasn’t. Ron was only anonymous when his internal network traffic became external and was routed through TOR's Onion servers, allowing him to change his public IP and proxy it to host it more securely and anonymously. This means that even if the FBI did manage to find the server, the his true identity would be truly anonymous and protected, more so if they didn't leave behind sensitive information about those that were involved with the site. This would also allow him to discard server data should he be compromised.</p> <p></p> <p>The problem with this is TOR only works when it's able to leave the internal network and communicate with TOR's onion servers. Any and all traffic that hasn't left the network yet is fully exposed and can be intercepted if someone breaches the internal network, which allows stuff like DNS spoofing and parsing techniques that can strip secure network traffic and handle it on behalf of the real DNS server itself, forwarding it as if it were never intercepted. </p> <p></p> <p>This also allows an attacker to bypass any form of segmentation that the main access point might have set in place on the local network. This is crucial in that it allowed Elliot to find the server on the local network regardless of whether or Ron might have had proper segmentation and routing configurations in place.</p> <p></p> <p>Regardless of how segmentation on the network is configured, any and ALL network traffic eventually has to talk to the final endpoint node on the network, the default gateway router. Because of this, Elliot was able to intercept the traffic and bypass the TOR onion protocol and locate, as well as excavate any and all sensitive data from the servers and put in an anonymous tip with the law enforcement to have Ron arrested with solid evidence to shut him down for good.</p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/BypassingTor" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

In this case since it’s WPA2, the end goal is to intercept the main handshake that occurs between the host and access point when it connects to the network.</p> <p></p> <p>Now you might be wondering, how do you get that information if host systems are already connected to AP? The handshake is complete so there’s no way to get that information right? Wait for them to reconnect? Why wait when you can just force them. What you essentially need to do in order to bypass the security, is “de-authenticate” them from the network, forcing them to reconnect.</p> <p></p> <p>In order to do this you need to tell the AP directly to de-authenticate them since it’s impossible to talk to the specific hosts on the network when you don’t have access to it.Think of the WAP as an HTTP web application server you can send requests and various HTTP headers to, to invoke various responses. In this process we are essentially doing the same thing, sending the right data packets in order to kick end users off the main access point and scan for the handshake in the process. All you NEED, is the right NIC card to perform passive recon for data packets.</p> <p></p> <p>The first step is to use airmon-ng in order to place your main NIC card into something that is called “monitor mode”. Monitor mode allows your NIC card to perform passive recon and sniff out any WAP’s, as well as host systems connected to them. It can also be used to check and kill any processes that might interfere with the scan such as the NetworkManager service for example. The next step is to use the airodump-ng command in order to scan RF channels to search for the SSID of the network AP you wish to target.</p> <p></p> <p>Once found, you can hone in on the AP and see any and all main systems that are connected to it as well, including any MAC addresses that could possibly allow you to bypass stuff like MAC filters that require you to have a trusted MAC address in order to connect to the network.</p> <p></p> <p>Next thing you want to do, while scanning the main AP with airodump-ng is pop open another shell session and then use the aireplay-ng command in order to send authentication packets to force end users to reconnect in order to secure the handshake. THIS PROCESS DOES TAKE TIME.</p> <p></p> <p>Now the question is, how to defend against this. Nowadays, AP’s are essentially “randomizing” the frequency channel to prevent people from scanning the access point.If you can’t scan it, then you can’t see the hosts that are on the network, as well as secure the main handshake. It’s something so simple that can stop hackers in their tracks.</p> </br></br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wifi-hacking-aircrack-ng-roy-bull-futaba-webs--bydbf/?trackingId=Zc1WbkyUSkampmjlJqWKuw%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

Well for starters, any and all tools, whether it be for offense or defense, have already been built from the ground up for you by skilled PROGRAMMERS. This means that stuff like: splunk, SOAR, SIEM, NMAP, Metasploit, etc, stuff that makes your job a lot easier, and automated, rely on very skilled programmers to develop them. </p> <p></p> <p>This also applies to large scale security systems and vendors set in place that allow infrastructures to easily install and set up security systems seamlessly. This allows businesses that might not have the best knowledge and skill set for required security compliance to meet any and all needs to have a secure infrastructure. Take programming away and we loose all of that.</p> <p></p> <p>If programming were to become extinct, then the new usage of tools to fight Cyber Security threats becomes null and void. You’d have to build them from the ground up which would require EVERYONE to know programming. The only reason it’s becoming less required is because there already exist teams that focus on that for you, like Security Engineers for example.</p> <p></p> <p>What is a Security Engineer? Well, as the name would suggest, they help design and implement various security measures within software and system infrastructures. They also implement secure coding practices in order to patch any and all vulnerabilities that might exist in software, as well as implement new measures for ongoing projects. They play a CRUCIAL role in the overall landscape of security threats. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "updates" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">There would be no Security Updates/Fixes 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>If you take away programming from Cyber Security, then who is supposed to patch and implement version control and new security fixes each time there is a major breach? I’m waiting………??? HELLOOOO????</p> <p></p> <p>This makes sense as the overall process for FDE is to enumerate THE ENTIRE file system ENTIRELY and encrypt EVERY single file on the system. Asymmetric would be too slow for this as it's a slower encryption standard. It's also commonly used in mobile device data encryption as well for the same reasons.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "tools" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">You can build your own tools! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I think one of the biggest advantages to being able to program is that you can design your own custom tools. All the stuff I’ve shown you so far from previous articles are all custom made by me. I have fine tune control of what I need my tools to do. </p> <p></p> <p>Programming your own tools also allows you to bypass security systems via obfuscation and evolve them if you are on the more offensive side of things. </p> <h4 id = "critically" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Programming teaches you how to critically think 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Programming teaches you how to think more logically and TRULY understand what goes on under the hood behind the tools that you use on a regular basis, making you more effective with them. There’s a difference between using a port scanner, and understanding what a port scanner is. Most know how to use the tool, but many don’t understand it. Another analogy for this is people that know how to use a computer but have ZERO technical skills with one.

The tool is designed to masquerade as a legitimate network access point and trick end users into connecting, posing as the router and intercepting any and all exit node traffic data that is sent to it, stripping it in the process to bypass secure communication methods. It interconnects with the main access point in the process and forwards the communication on its behalf to your target destination as if nothing ever happened. </p> <p></p> <p>But, WE'RE much better than that. You shouldn't have to rely on someone else’s tool to get the job done. Are you a hacker or aren't you? I'm going to show you HOW to perform the exploit without one and the raw natural science behind it. </p> <p></p> <p>HOWEVER, since this involves WIFI hacking and network penetration testing, I recommend you check out my previous article that covers more on this topic as it goes over a lot of terminology that you might be unfamiliar with. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "rogue" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a Rogue Access Point? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Rogue access points are wireless access points that masquerade as an original access point in order to trick end users into connecting to them, or as access points that one would assume is safe to access. Once the victim connects it, simulates that of a REAL network, gateway portal and all (the login page you see when you connect to free WiFi). Once the end user is on the network they will start to use it and try to access websites that they would typically use, some requiring them to login and send over sensitive credentials. This also includes any and all forms of MFA data that is sent over as well, allowing hackers to bypass their security. What happens next involves a process known as DNS poisoning.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "dns" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is DNS Poisoning? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>DNS Poisoning is similar to a technique known as ARP poisoning, where you poison the ARP cache of a network or switch gateway device in order to receives copies of what other systems on the network are sending to and from the network. </p> <p></p> <p>To put it simply with a example that is easy to understand, you’re spoofing the end user MAC/IP addresses on the network OR, directly targeting the ARP cache of the gateway device to intercept their traffic, which in return will lead to you also receiving a copy of what the target system receives as they send data over the network. This will lead to you being able to capture stuff like sensitive credentials, even bypassing secure communications like HTTPS since you can’t spy on that through normal means using stuff like wireshark or TCPdump. If you try to do so you will get nothing. </p> <p></p> <p>HOWEVER, in this case we are spoofing and manipulating the DNS routing that is set in place in order to redirect the end user to malicious sites of our choosing. DNS occurs on port 53 and is what the default gateway uses in order to handle and route network traffic on your behalf while browsing the internet. This is handy in case you happen to misspell something when entering in a site name. It also handles stuff like converting name based IP addresses back to their respective numeral format so that you can browse the internet with ease. </p> <p></p> <p>What we are going to do in this case, for demonstration purposes, is setup a rogue access point that will have a system on the network “acting” like the default gateway. Once the end user connects to it, we are going to have them routed to it, and then spoof sites like google via the host configuration file to route the end user on our behalf to the apache server that will contain a spoofed server usingHTTPRACKwhen they try to visit it. The goal of the attack is to have it log down any sensitive credentials that are sent from the client, which we will check via the apache logs via the configuration file located here/var/log/apache2/access.log</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "disconnect" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">I just won’t connect to any AP’s that aren’t mine! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Here’s where you’re wrong about that and how you can still get hacked. Remember the last article where I talked about how the whole process of breaching a wireless access point involved sending de-authentication packets? We do this in order to bounce systems off the network and force them to re-authenticate in order to secure the 4 way handshakes for WPA2 wireless encryption. This can also be applied here to kick you off your own network and pop you onto the rogue one. </p> <p></p> <p>When you connect to an access point in general your system looks for the SSID to connect to in name based format. If an attacker creates one of the same name and then kicks everyone else off the main one, who do you think it will prioritize? This can also be done via Jamming methods, combining the de-authentication method I’ve just discussed so far. It's because of this that Evil Twin attackers are able to bypass randomized AP channel security that is often seen on AP devices.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "jamming" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What are Jamming Attacks? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Jamming attacks jam the signal of the original access point so that victims on the network can only connect to yours when they attempt to re-authenticate back to the main AP. It causes a form of RF interference that prevents the main AP from allowing end users to connect back to it. Think of this like a form of DOS, where you block the router, in this case, so that only your AP can be interacted with if that makes sense.</p> <p></p> <p>This process is done exploiting something that is known as a “Transmit Power Level” (PWR) that is set in order to change the overall quality of the RF frequency that emits electromagnetic signals that transmit wireless data from one end point to another via a data channel line. It has an integer value, where the lower the number the better the quality. Find one that is of better quality or a match and you'll be able to jam the AP if yours is better. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "rogue" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How to spot that you are on one 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the biggest dead giveaways to knowing that you are on a rogue access point is the classic lack of HTTP for sites that typically have them. If you ever notice that your network traffic doesn’t appear to be “secure” for sites that typically have HTTPS and such for them then you know that you are on one. </p> <p></p> <p>Be mindful just because a site has “HTTPS” doesn't mean it’s secure either if you were browsing from a legitimate access point. These are just key things to look out for if you are in these particular situations. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "bypass" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Evil Twin Attacks Bypass Random AP Channel Security 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Before we dive into what Ransomware is, let's go over what FDE is, since it heavily applies to the topic for today.</p> <p></p> <p>FDE, full disk encryption, is a defensive technique that is used to harden data protection across all hierarchical flat file systems. It's the overall process of enumerating the entire file system, and then applying what is known as symmetric cryptography in order to encrypt the entire data storage medium. A good example of this would be bitlocker, which is commonly used for Windows system infrastructures.</p> <p></p> <p>As you know, data encryption is irreversible without the crypto keys, so by performing this method and leaving the keys out the hands of the attacker, should they breach the system, whether it be digitally or physically, any and all data they steal will be useless to them.</p> <h4 id = "hypothetically">How to Hypothetically bypass randomized channels without Evil Twin? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>It’s quite simple, there are only a finite number of channels that we can send de-authenticate packets to, so if we wanted to, hypothetically, we can also randomize using the Aircrack-ng tool via a bash script that will randomize our channels as well so that we will eventually hit the AP. All we need is ONE of them to connect and the exploit will be successful. </p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "exploit" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Exploit 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>For this exploit, all you are going to need are two access points with different qualities in PA levels, one weaker than the other in order to kick the end user off the network. You can use whatever you want, BUT, in case you want a easy setup I recommend this product right here. You'll also need the NIC card that is listed here as well if you want to kick them off the network via de-authentication packets.</p> <p></p> <p><a href = "https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-SDWS4-016G-G46-Sandisk-Connect-16GB/dp/B00ZCFYDLA/ref=asc_df_B00ZCFYDLA/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=385197824350&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12478942917798341849&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9067609&hvtargid=pla-479466799164&psc=1&mcid=db642fbea31d3800972b9f377fac9ab2&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=76690811457&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=385197824350&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12478942917798341849&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9067609&hvtargid=pla-479466799164&gclid=CjwKCAiAi6uvBhADEiwAWiyRds9gIRl1_TzjEcLdE-Cj83t7nie6QbKjCTqVZOHsFO_200NVV2kDWBoCr7cQAvD_BwE" style = "text-decoration: none;">SanDisk Wireless Flash Drive</a> </p> <p></p> <p><a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Alfa-Long-Range-Dual-Band-Wireless-External/dp/B00VEEBOPG/ref=asc_df_B00VEEBOPG/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=309777534894&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=661451366676614644&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9067609&hvtargid=pla-406165012713&psc=1&mcid=77bc9198dfae3589b73068333f6e0b4e&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=58425267301&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=309777534894&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=661451366676614644&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9067609&hvtargid=pla-406165012713&gclid=Cj0KCQiArrCvBhCNARIsAOkAGcUeiotTlpUEhgZHW53hz7zd008q-HYczYEUYfkTd-nMqiswJxSsrcYaAlqOEALw_wcB" style = "text-decoration: none;">AlfaAC1200</a></p> <p></p> <p>This little toy here, the SanDisk Wireless Flash drive is one of the best “unintended” hacking tools that you could possibly own. WHY? Well, it’s a wireless access point you can connect to and share files over and save stuff too. You can practice network penetration testing on the go with this and do whatever you want. The default gateway also has all HTTP methods allowed so you can practice hacking them, that, and it also allows you to daisy chain to a main AP just like the WiFi pineapple. It also happens to have a weaker PA level that we can exploit. That, and unlike most AP’s today, you can practice WIFI hacking against it since it doesn't have randomized channels for security. </p> <p></p> <p></p> </br> </br> <p>Now, the exploit:</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 First, set the SSID of the SanDisk AP to anyone that you desire. You can do this for the gateway portal where all the configurations are located.</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Next, add systems to the network and then have them connect to the target AP gateway portal of the system to check if you are on the right network. If they can talk to the portal then you are good to go. </p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Next, pop open a router that you have and change its SSID to that of the SanDisk one, and then, and this is also CRUCIAL, set the password for the Access point to NONE. You need to do this so that the end users are automatically authenticated to the AP. This creates the illusion they are re-authenticating, allowing you to go undetected. </p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Next, pop open my video that I’ve provided and follow along up until “2:50”, which is where you will see the main AP of the Sandisk Flash drive being de-athenticated. This also shows you how to setup the NIC to sniff AP's Follow those very steps to kick end users off the network, and watch as they bounce to the rogue one that you’ve created. Once that’s done check if you have clients on the rogue network. If they are, then the exploit was a success!</p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/TheEvilTwinAttack" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

This is a form of obfuscation technique that can also be used in order to avoid detection from various security systems, which can also allow the malware to command and control via communication with the bot master SECURELY. </p> <p></p> <p>As you know, computer systems, much like a human, are UNABLE to decipher data encryption. It comes up as garble to them. This allows the malware to remain invisible and not trigger any flags set by security systems.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "armored" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Armored Virus 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Armored malware focuses on defensive measures that make it hard to remove.

The tool is so seamless and easy to use that even people that don’t understand anything about hacking could pull it off, hence its ban being set into motion. But… What if I told you it’s pointless to ban it? </p> <p></p> <p>I want to talk about why it’s pointless to ban the Flipper Zero, as well as some basic things that could be done to prevent motor vehicle car theft with it, as well as other methods similar to it.</p> <p></p> <p>I also want to talk about how Cyber Security is a game of chess, and how it is meant to be played to deter Cyber threats. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "flipperzero" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the Flipper Zero? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The Flipper Zero Tamagotchi is a multi functioning tool that is able to intercept, clone, and replay various data communication methods specifically tailored to Radio/RF and RFID/NFC. This allows it to clone any form of authentication credentials that might pertain to the end user, allowing a threat actor to bypass security and access the system.</p> <p></p> <p>In simpler terms, it’s able to clone the unique signature and data that is exchanged via remote control, such as a automobile car remote that unlocks the car door for you, or via RFID/NFC device tap, which exchanges data when you tap things like your ID badge to access a control room for example. It can even be simpler things like the NFC chips that are installed on our debit/credit cards, or our phones when we “tap” it to make purchases on a regular basis or access various facilities like storage units. An attacker could use this to: break into your car, purchase things on your behalf, access control systems and authenticate as if they were you, and a lot more. The list goes on!</p> <p></p> <p>This technique is also what is known as a Replay Attack, which is commonly used to intercept crypto keys in order to perform a Wrapping Attack that allows an attacker to man in the middle and change the overall contents of the data that is being exchanged as if they were the original sender, while using the key to peek and do so each time.</p> <p></p> <p>If you ban the Flipper Zero then you have to ban every hacking tool that exists</p> <p></p> <p>There are a ton of hacking tools on the market, even ones from <a href = "https://shop.hak5.org/" style = "text-decoration: none;">Hack5</a> that also can do what the Flipper Zero does. To ban the Flipper Zero, means to ban all these tools as well. </p> <p></p> <p>Take For example the HackRF One which can also analyze RF frequencies for various purposes like the Flipper Zero and imitate them. It’s been around long before the Flipper Zero was ever made and it has yet to be banned. The only difference between the two, is that one is more accessible than the other. If that’s the case, then we need to upgrade our security so silly stuff like this DOESN’T happen. Rule of thumb, IF A SCRIPT KIDDIE CAN PWN IT, IT’S A PROBLEM!</p> <p></p> <p>Besides, it’s easy to make your own Flipper Zero if you're skilled enough to do so. You can even name it whatever you want and bypass the ban. The Flipper Zero isn’t anything we haven’t seen before, it’s just cute and popular!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "lackofsecurity" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">It’s not the Flipper Zero, It’s our lack of Security 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The problem isn't the Flipper Zero, it’s our lack of proper understanding of security practices that can be used to effectively neutralize the threat.</p> <p></p> <p>It’s no shocker that the implementation of Cyber Security practices are just now becoming a standard, with legal aspects cracking down HARD and punishing infrastructures for not implementing it, via fines and other means. This is because we are moving closer and closer to a more digital landscape where everything is connected, which is good news for hackers, since it extends the scope and range of what they can target now more than ever.</p> <p></p> <p>Security has been one of the many things ignored for far too long. It’s the main reason why we have so many security breaches. Most systems, even basic stuff like web applications, don’t factor security in terms of overall design. It’s our job to ensure that anything and everything is properly secured regardless of what format said technology comes from. This also includes automobiles, which is the main topic for today since it relates to the Flipper Zero Tamagotchi.</p> <p></p> <p>The problem now is that we are just now catching up, while hackers have already done their homework and pretty much can stay ahead of the game. We need to do the same!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "chess" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Cyber Security Is A Game of Chess 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Cyber Security is a game of chess. What do I mean by that? I think the best example would be the classic one I provide a lot in my articles, my CTF server, <a href = "https://github.com/RoyMBull/Futabas_Playground" style = "text-decoration: none;">“Futaba’s Playground”</a>.</p> <p></p> <p>When I made the CTF server I basically had to “play this game of chess”, where I had to think several steps ahead of the player as they progressed throughout the game as if they were a “real” adversary. I had to think of all the possible variables of what the player could do to bypass my security and cheat the game.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, I ran into an issue where the player could easily access critical files on the server that would allow them to capture flags in unintended ways. This could easily be done via the browser, as well as ssh shells which are intended for the player to progress. This is a HUGE no go, so I needed to put a stop to that pronto. </p> <p></p> <p>My thought process to upgrade security was to figure out how to block easy web application access to the files, while also blocking ssh system command access to the files, and on top of this, I needed to make sure the server account hosting the web application could still read the files, while also ensuring the player could progress. Still with me? I know, this was a major headache for me too and took a lot of trial and error until I got it right!</p> <p></p> <p>The remedy for this was to: set the files on the server to ownership of the main account that reads it, that way only it and root users can access it. Root access can only be done on the final stage of the game, so by the time the player manages to get to all the files it will already be too late. See what I did there? I did a lot more, but of course, NO SPOILERS!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "prevent" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How to prevent automobile theft via the Flipper Zero (IN THEORY) 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>In theory, and it’s quite simple, the best way to prevent automobile theft with the Flipper Zero is to implement the same methods that prevent Replay Attacks in general: splitting the data channels so that authenticated credentials to unlock the motor vehicle are not sent alongside each other. You can even layer frequency randomization on top of that much like with wireless access points to throw the tool off, that way it misses its target. These little things can hurt the effectiveness of the tool greatly.</p> <p></p> <p>I don’t specialize in motor vehicle security, but I’m pretty sure there are a ton of other methods that can prevent the Flipper Zero from hacking into car systems. We just need to implement the security in place to do so!</p> <p></p> <p>If you have any other ideas that could improve motor vehicle security, feel free to drop your thoughts bellow in the comment section. I’d love to hear your own thoughts on the matter? </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/Totsugeki" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

This also leads to a lot of people taking a lot of shortcuts that set them back in the long run, making them underprepared to enter the field. </p> <p></p> <p>Regardless of what side you are on: red team, blue team, purple team, or the type of technology you help secure, you NEED to have a deep understanding of it if you truly wish to secure it. </p> <p></p> <p>If you are a red teamer, you need to understand how various core technologies work in order to exploit them. This allows you to find critical flaws in the system you are testing against so it can be properly secured. How can you exploit something when you don’t understand how it works? Yes there are tons of tools, SQLmap for example, that can help red teamers pinpoint SQL injection vulnerabilities, but you still need to understand how SQL injection works on a fundamental level to use it properly. The tool is only as good as your fundamental understanding of the vulnerability it was designed to exploit. Not understanding how to find this type of vulnerability, even with the tool could cause you to miss critical vulnerabilities that did in fact exist, which can cause A LOT OF real world damage to an infrastructure if left unchecked.</p> <p></p> <p>If you are a blue teamer, you need to understand how core technologies work on a fundamental level so you can properly secure them. How can you secure something when you don’t understand how it works? Take the CTF server I made for example, <a href = "https://github.com/RoyMBull/Futabas_Playground" style = "text-decoration: none;">"Futaba's Playground"</a>. It requires me to understand proper secure coding principles, as well as Linux system administration and configurations in order to properly secure the server. This prevents the player from bypassing any security for any and all challenges in unintended ways. I secured the server as if it were a real system from real threats, YOU, the player. If I wanted to take it a step further I can combine it with already pre-made tools and frameworks like SIEM and SOAR for example, that upgrade and smoothen the process for me depending on what I need it for. See where I’m going with this? </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "programming"style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">YoU DoNt NeEd PrOgRAmMiNg FoR cYBeR sEcUrItY 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I wrote an article a while back on why programming is crucial for Cyber Security. You can check that out <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-programming-import-cyber-security-roy-bull-futaba-webs--sm80e/?trackingId=1l%2BRV%2FzwQUatieczffa%2Fig%3D%3D&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BVEzx1nN%2FR3S024KklIANNg%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a> if you would like to. For now, I’m going to talk a bit about forensics, one of the main fields in Cyber that people want to get into but REFUSE to learn how to code for. A lot of this is due to what I mentioned earlier, about people being sold the false notion they don’t need to be technical to work in Cyber. You do need to be technical if you want to get into forensics. Forensics is crucial in that it stops the spread of malware should it pose a real worldwide threat. </p> <p></p> <p>Forensics, most of which involves a lot of reverse engineering and malware analysis, does in fact require you to know how to code, as well as be able to read it regardless of what programming language it might be in. Does it require you to understand how to program in every language and framework under the sun? No! But you do need to understand how code works, as well as the technology behind it under the hood. This also requires in depth technical knowledge about stuff like a debugger which allows you to trace binary code flow. </p> <p></p> <p>You need to understand how to write code so that you can replicate and/ or tamper with strains of malware you find. This allows you to cross test and find mitigations to secure against future malware infections. </p> <p></p> <p>You need to understand how to read code, regardless of whether or not it might be a language you’re familiar with in order to dissect it. Sure, stick to malware in languages that you are familiar with, but often in the realm of Cyber Security, hackers are creative, and you’ll often find unicorn-like malware or techniques that you didn’t know about. You need to be able to adapt, and interpret it. Reading code is hard due to the nature of how sloppy and undocumented most code is written. You need to get comfortable with that and understand how to read and follow along core programming logic to understand how malware works. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "networking"style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Networking and Building your brand 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>BUILD YOUR BRAND! BUILD YOUR BRAAANNND! I Can’t stress this enough. The market for Cyber Security is HIGHLY competitive right now. You need to stand out. Even if you are a skilled professional, people need to know who you are. Remember, it’s not about what you know (even though it is in Cyber), it’s about WHO, you know. Even if you are a skilled professional, if no one is able to see what you can do, and it’s not interactive then NOBODY CARES!!! Get used to that. Would you hire the nobody, or the somebody that has shown what they can do? Remember, this is a HIGH paying COMPETITIVE field, where places are looking to hire the best of the best. They are investing in YOU, to secure their systems, so don’t disappoint! There are tons of skilled people, but not many that show off what they can do, and lose out to many that are unqualified due to poor marketing. All brain and no aim. </p> <p></p> <p>Take for example, my brand <a href = "https://linktr.ee/Futaba_Webs" style = "text-decoration: none;">Futaba_Webs</a>. I’ve been in the dark for a while now about my skill sets and was just mindlessly applying to jobs and hoping for the best. I wasn’t networking or marketing myself so that professionals could engage with me and see my skill sets. This HURT me a lot, especially as someone that is self taught and cannot easily afford certifications. I have a lot of skill, most of which is “abnormal” from the level I should be at professionally in case you haven’t noticed. Despite what my resume says, I’ve been in tech for YEARS, and in each role, if you read closely, I was ALWAYS involved in some form of Cyber Security in each one. </p> <p></p> <p>The results I got? Constant connections flooding in, my brand going in the right direction, being asked to provide MORE mentorship and when I'll be doing it with a program I plan to announce soon <a href = "https://www.patreon.com/Futaba_Webs" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>, as well as being on the radar of high ranking and high level well established Cyber Security professionals. The results have been insane, and the support that has followed with it has been amazing as well. I’ve also been tagged in regards to large scale conferences and asked to speak at them, one I plan to do soon. </p> <p></p> <p>Even all of my articles and tutorials have been clever strategies to help advertise and sell my brand and get people to support my work so that they feel comfortable supporting my product I plan to launch soon which people have been asking for more of. People want to support you and aid you, but you have to PROVE you are legit. GET YOUR NAME OUT THERE NOW!!!!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "selfdev"style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Say No to Self-Development 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>If you don’t like having to constantly learn and adapt, then maybe this isn’t the field for you. In case you haven’t noticed, Cyber Security is an ever evolving landscape, where threats are constantly evolving. You need to stay in the loop on new technologies and methods hackers use to breach systems. This information alone allows us to improve our overall security infrastructures and keep them safe. Refusing to adapt is like refusing to update from Windows XP to the latest firmware. You pick up what I’m putting down? </p> </br> </br></br> <h4 id = "communication"style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Communication Skills Are Over Hyped 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Trying to sell CyberSecurity products and spread security awareness? Part of the reason no one takes their security practices seriously is due to the lack of understanding of it, and how it’s explained. Notice how ALL of my articles I go into FULL detail and break technical concepts down to their simplest form, with examples that are easy to understand while still retaining their core technical aspects. Notice how this entire article I’ve essentially done the same thing, while still being technical but not TOO technical. You understand? Good! </p> <p></p> <p>You need to be mindful that not everyone is technical and some people need it to be explained to them in simpler terms.

It’s not news by now that a lot of people in Cyber are just looking to sell you false hopes and dreams, empty promises that are just a mere cash grab. LEARN CYBER SECURITY IN 24 WEEKS AND MASTER— You pick up what I’m putting down right?</p> <p></p> <p>Not everyone has the best intentions for you, and some, quite frankly… even those that have been in the field for years with a shiny title… Don’t know their stuff and THEY are the ones that are holding the high level certs and positions.</p> <p></p> <p>You need to also be mindful, THERE IS A LOT OF GATEKEEPING in this field. People are willing to lead others down the wrong path if it means they keep you out and or get in. If you’re looking for a mentor, make sure you check their credibility and look into them before you check in for services with them. I recommend looking for mentors that are SHOWING you what they know vs ones that HIDE all of their stuff. YouTube content creators like Rana Khali, who now runs her own academy is a classic example of someone that has established solid credibility and trust that you can look into if you need mentorship. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "part2" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Why is finding a mentor so hard? (Part 2) 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Much like how not all mentors have the best of intentions, the same can also be said for mentees. </p> <p></p> <p>Mentees, for those that do not know, have been known to take advantage of their mentors, especially the free ones who are commonly sought after. A lot of this is due to a sense of entitlement and them using any means to get in, even if they have to exploit their fellow learners and mentors in the process. Not everyone is looking to win with you so you need to be mindful of that!</p> <p></p> <p>A lot of people, and I’m sorry to even have to say this, belittle mentors, specifically ones that help for free. Some even ghost their mentors after they help them land a job. It’s these very critical reasons why free mentors are stepping away, most charging you now for their time. People don't want to be taken advantage of. </p> <p></p> <p>This also explains the main reason why people aren’t very “friendly” when you DM them and ask them for tips and tricks, and why if you do get a “free” answer, it's rather vague.</p> <p></p> <p>For me personally, it is the main reason why I have rejected EVERY SINGLE person that has asked for free mentorship thus far. All it takes is for ONE bad cookie, and it has a rippling effect. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "mentorable" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Are you Mentorable? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Most people sadly aren’t mentorable. More times than none, as someone that mentors consistently, PEOPLE DO NOT LISTEN TO THEIR MENTORS! If you are going to seek mentorship LISTEN TO THE PROFESSIONALS advice, especially if it comes from one that is highly credible.</p> <p></p> <p>People are looking for shortcuts to get in, and when they find out there aren’t any, and they have to do and learn the thing, they bail out and stop listening to their mentor, thinking they are trying to mislead them. THEY AREN’T, AND YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO THEM, otherwise you are just setting yourself back, and wasting everyone’s valuable time!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "notrecruiters" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">MENTORS ARE NOT RECRUITERS! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Mentors are NOT recruiters. It’s not their job to land you a role, that’s YOUR job, as well as the job of a recruiter. </p> <p></p> <p>People often leave their mentorships due to not securing a role, because they have the impression that their mentor is responsible for that. They don’t owe you that nor should you expect that from them, especially if they are trying to help you for free. </p> <p></p> <p>They are there to guide/teach you how Cyber Security works so that you build up the skill sets needed to succeed in this field. It’s YOUR job to decide what you do with that knowledge. No one is responsible for your success but you!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "communication" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Communication is KEY! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Keep in touch with your mentor! It’s CRUCIAL! As I’ve mentioned before, there is a lot of ghosting going around lately towards mentors that put in a lot of time to help their mentees, especially ones that do so for FREE. Respect their time and keep in touch!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "personal" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Keep your personal feelings outside of your mentorship 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I cannot stress this enough, and this also applies to the real world in general, NO ONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR PERSONAL PROBLEMS. Don’t take your personal issues out on your mentor. They are here to help you! It’s your job to stay in touch and give that bit of communication in case something does happen so they can understand. People can’t understand you if you don’t communicate! </p> <p></p> <p>RESPECT YOUR MENTORS!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "free" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Do you want FREE learning or FREE Mentorship? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A lot of people think that the thing they want is FREE learning, but it’s not, it’s free mentorship and guidance which no one owes you! </p> <p></p> <p>Teaching yourself anything from the ground up is possible, but it’s EXTREMELY HARD! There is no one to guide you or explain the stuff you need to know. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.</p> <p></p> <p>I’ve been self taught for about 11 years now and I reassure you, figuring out where I had to go for Cyber was hard. I was running around in circles trying to figure stuff out. I wasn’t able to find a Cyber mentor due to all the things that I’ve mentioned, which is why I put so much effort into it.

There are seven types: white, black, gray, green, blue, red, and purple. Each hat has an agenda and purpose and plays a HUGE role in protecting our digital landscape.</p> <p></p> <p>I'm also going to go over what a script kiddie is since there is A HUGE difference between them and one particular hat that is apart of the main category that is going to be discussed today.</p> <p></p> <p>You’ll also get more in depth as to why my head line says I am a “Gray Hat Hacker”. A lot of people, and I’ve talked with a few, have no idea what the hat’s actually stand for and why we use them. </p> <p></p> <p>It’s important, especially if you are going to be a part of hacker culture. It will come up in topics, so it’s best you know what they all stand for. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "white" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">White Hat Hackers 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>White hat hackers are basically the good guys, the Cyber Security professionals that help defend various system and business infrastructures, as well as being responsible for the very security that is implemented in them as well. Without them, there would be no form of security in any and all forms of technology, and we would all be exposed to various threats. This is why “Cyber Security” exists. If you are in Cyber Security, then by default you are a white hat hacker, unless you identify otherwise. </p> <p></p> <p>They are also penetration testers that focus on exploiting a system in order to find vulnerabilities in a system, reporting it so that the side that defends can mitigate the threat so that real threat actors are unable to take advantage of it. This is typically done in the fashion of finding the flaw in the system before someone else does. </p> <p></p> <p>This hat is split into 2 unique categories, that I’m pretty sure you might already be familiar with, red team and blue team. </p> <p></p> <p>Red teamers, are the offensive security professionals like penetration testers for example who attack to find weaknesses in the system, and report them. </p> <p></p> <p>Blue teamers, are the defenders, who specialize in the core implementation of security remedies that help protect system infrastructures, as well as being first responders to various security breaches that occur within business infrastructures. </p> <p></p> <p>Each team has their own set of specialties and roles that dive deeper into the matter of what they do, but I'll leave that for another article explaining the both of them, so you can get a better idea of where you might want to start out in Cyber Security. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "black" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Black Hat Hackers 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>These are the bad guys, legit threat actors that seek to exploit a system for personal game: money, data, fame, etc. Unlike white hat hackers who have major restrictions and limitations on what they can and can’t do when conducting an official penetration test, black hat hackers don’t have this restraint. They exploit systems in any and all various ways, which is why we have to keep evolving our mitigation tactics in order to neutralize cyber crime. They are the main reason we are in an ever ending fight to protect the digital landscape. </p> <p></p> <p>They also tend to operate on places like the dark web, providing illegal services from various means based on their skill set. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "gray" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Gray Hat Hackers 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>White hat hackers are basically the good guys, the Cyber Security professionals that help defend various system and business infrastructures, as well as being responsible for the very security that is implemented in them as well.

In case you haven't noticed, black hat hackers aren’t well received.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "green" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Green Hat Hackers 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>For those of you who are new to hacking, this would be where you currently lay.</p> <p></p> <p>Green hat Hackers are newcomers that are honing their skills. </p> </br> </br></br> <h4 id = "script" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Script Kiddies 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>NOT to be confused for a green hat, who actually knows a thing or two about hacking, script kiddies are hackers, if you could call them that, that rely on someone else's tools and techniques without proper understanding to hack people. </p> <p></p> <p>The good news about these types of hackers is they will ALWAYS be predictable and are easy to counter and neutralize. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "blue" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Blue Hat Hackers 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A common trick that a lot of people like to use in order to prevent unauthorized network breaches, is they like to hide their SSID’s which is the name of the network. This is effective in that you can hide SSID information from common means of exposure, like the GUI you use when selecting a wireless access point to communicate with.</p> <p></p> <p>The problem with this is it can easily be bypassed by the same method mentioned in option #2 of how to bypass MAC address filtering. </p> <p></p> <p>Your SSID is also broadcasted along with any and all MAC address information that is sent out in data packets. They have to be, otherwise our IoT devices would be unable to pick them up and identify them. THERE IS ALWAYS A WAY TO BYPASS ANYTHING! NOTHING IS 100 PERCENT SECURE!</p> <p></p> <p>Today’s positive bonuses will focus more on how to defend against MAC address filtering bypasses, preventing an attacker from breaching the network via this security method.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "purple" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Purple Hat Hackers 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>These hackers are basically revenge hackers, or in a sense, suicide hackers depending on the situation. </p> <p></p> <p>They can also be script kiddies and or new hackers that are taking revenge on someone else.</p> <p></p> <p>They can also be white hat hackers, or disgruntled employees that have gone rogue, which can pose a real threat especially when it’s from inside the main infrastructure. </p> <p></p> <p>This term can also be for hackers that are contractors, invited to test for security flaws within software products that have yet to be released. They are hired based on their reputational value.</p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/HackingPersona" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

I wanted to raise more awareness and teach people how to protect their digital identity! A lot of the article will be me addressing what happened, as well as remedies I gave her to protect herself.</p> <p></p> <p>This is also the start of a new series that is called the “DANGER!” series, where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities within system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, where I also talk about mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent such threats.</p> <p></p> <p>There will also be a LIVE demonstration for those of you who are subscribed to my patreon, to see how closely I can exploit mobile end devices in order to retrieve any and all sensitive data from the mobile end device! There will also be a step by step exploit guide walking you through the entire process as well, and how to gelocate someone’s phone and turn it into a GPS tracker!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "connected" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! Everything is connected 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the biggest things about technology is that EVERYTHING is connected. When isn't something going online? Even stuff like electric toothbrushes are being connected to the internet. We also have stuff like smart homes and other various means of smart technology that make our lives easier. </p> <p></p> <p>The problem with all of this is that it also makes life easier for Hackers. Everything being connected extends the main scope and attack surface for them, allowing threat actors to further exploit systems in various ways. We are in a sense creating our own colossal monolithic structure where everything is both connected and further dependent on each other, which can be lethal in VARIOUS ways! </p> <p></p> <p>What do I mean by this? Well, for starters, let’s say that a hospital system that contained a multitude of life support systems were connected online and to various networks. What would happen if a threat actor with ill intentions breached the network? </p> <p></p> <p>If an attacker were to breach it, they would essentially be able to play GOD, controlling the entire system and being able to choose whether or not actual Lives were lost. If they wanted to, they could shut down all the power systems, even the backups since a lot of this stuff seems to be connected nowadays, killing EVERYONE on life support in the process.</p> <p></p> <p>Another example, would be the woman whose mobile device I talked about was breached, allowing the attacker to control her entire mobile phone and anything she gave it access to: smart home tech, Bluetooth devices, sessions that she had on, etc. The hacker was also able to ruin her credit as a lot of her personal information and files were on the system, and they happened to gain access to that as well, even sensitive contacts and messages that were directly on her phone. One little device cost her EVERYTHING and put her and the people she cares about at risk!</p> <p></p> <p>This also gets scary because, let’s say that her phone was used to authenticate to anything within an organization that she worked for. It would lead to a massive scale breach. A lot of infrastructures are still new to solid Cyber Security practices so things like this DO happen!</p> <p></p> <p>If they wanted to spoof her and do spear phishing, like I’ve mentioned, they have access to ALL of her contacts and can pull up that information. They can even spoof her number and do all sorts of nasty stuff with it, like bypassing any and all MFA she has on the phone, allowing them to even do scary stuff like wiring themselves money out of her bank account. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "traced" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! You can be traced! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Your phone is a walking GPS locator! If your phone gets hacked YOU ARE IN DANGER!</p> <p></p> <p>One of the scariest things the woman that got hacked didn’t realize.. WAS SHE WAS NOW A WALKING GPS target for them to find anytime they needed to. This meant that anytime she was around friends or family, their address and location information, or should she even connect to their home network, COULD ALL BE TRACED AND COMPROMISED in one go. She was basically a walking botnet they could command and control all in one go. </p> <p></p> <p>For many that do not realize this, your phone is connected to a cellular network via a sim card that is attached to it, allowing it to connect to the cellular network, which provides you with a private IP address that is then converted to a PUBLIC IP address that can be used to allow you to connect to the internet from your phone. </p> <p></p> <p>This means that if an attacker wanted to, they could secure your POSSIBLE location regardless of where you are as you ALWAYS tend to have your phone on you! Hackers can exploit this and ping your every move! Even if this method is debunked it's still possible to trace you with the device via other alternatives. I ran a few tests with this. If someone were to breach your device and you were connected to a personal network, such as your home network it would also be highly possible for them to ping your location since it's connected to your home network as well. You also have to keep in mind there are apps on your phone that give your location details away since you give the permission to collect that from you depending on the application.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "hijacking" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! Session Hijacking/MFA bypassing 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Your mobile device is one of the greatest forms of session hijacking. Session hijacking is where you are able to breach a victim's system and “use” any sessions that are currently in progress on them. </p> <p></p> <p>For example, your Facebook session. If you tell Facebook to keep you logged in, it will generate a cookie that can be used to remember your session and progress, which you can pick up on even if you’ve powered the system on and off. This can be critical and fatal, since an attacker could exploit this should you leave your system unattended anytime in order to do stuff like: wire themselves money via Facebook pay, change your credentials, access sensitive conversations and pretend to be you, etc, and since this is on your mobile device they will of course have access to the various means to bypass MFA on your mobile device!</p> </br></br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DangerMobileDeviceSecurity" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

I’m also going to show you how to botnet and command and control with the burp suite proxy server and how to strip any and all network traffic on a multitude of systems using it! </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "burp" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Burp Suite Proxy Server 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The burp suite proxy server is used to intercept and analyze network traffic and handle it in various ways. It is one of the most commonly used tools when testing against OWASP vulnerabilities within web application systems. THIS IS A STAPLE TOOL THAT YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO USE!</p> <p></p> <p>It can be used either for defense or for offense. In our case, we are going to talk about how it applies to offensive capabilities.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "proxy" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Proxy mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Burp suite has a feature in it that is called Proxy mode, where you can focus the tool on intercepting various network data communication methods. </p> <p></p> <p>With this particular method, you’ll be able to boot up a dummy browser session that can be used to test and track any communications that you personally send to a web application host target. Burp suite uses selenium in order to craft a test chromium browser session. </p> <p></p> <p>Why for yourself? Well, for starters, you can use the tool to gather in depth information on all the parameters and HTTP headers that are being sent to a target. You also have the ability to manipulate them and control how the server side will respond to you. It’s how hackers tend to test various fuzzing methods that will allow them to bypass security and exploit a system.</p> <p></p> <p>You can also use this feature to analyze any and all main scripts that are on the page, and follow network traffic as it pivots within the main internal, as well as any external domains that the tool might catch. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "foxy" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Foxy Proxy Mode (Firefox extension) 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now, this isn’t an exact feature that is a part of the main burp suite tool set, BUT, Firefox has a dedicated extension that allows you to set up a main proxy server on a system in order to forward all traffic to a main proxy server you have in a listening state.</p> <p></p> <p>This means that for an attacker, if we wanted to, and if we got creative, WE CAN BOTNET USING BURP SUITE. You can sit this on your system on a network, configure the extension on any and all systems on the network as well as the proxy server itself, and then BOOM, you can strip any and all network traffic, deciphering any and all credentials you can intercept.</p> <p></p> <p>You can also get creative and configure burp suite as a main proxy server within the network settings of the system you are looking to infect. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "intruder" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Intruder Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This mode is used for brute force based attacks, where you can send network traffic from the main HTTP socket history, and then handle it to inject word list points in them to have the tool brute force against. You can even set up the tool to allow stuff like pitch force brute forcing which is used to test against login time outs to bypass brute force protection on a main system.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "repeater" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Repeater Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Remember how I said that the burp suite tool can be used to manipulate the HTTP parameters and other information that is sent in the main request from client to server?</p> <p></p> <p>This mode allows you to do just that, store, modify, and repeat until you get a desired response form the server. This is crucial in case you wish to do stuff like SQL injection or RCE, and you need to see additional information that isn't shown to you from the main GUI of the site page. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "decoder" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Decoder Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This IS YOUR BREAD AND BUTTER IF YOU ARE FUZZING. What this mode allows you to do is type and encode as you need to, as well as being able to decode in case you need it to do so as well. </p> <p></p> <p>Let's say for example, you found a critical flaw in a system that allows you to RCE a server, but it doesn't allow white spaces or certain characters. It can be tricky jumping back and forth between an online encoder to handle the process for you. You can use this tool to handle all of that for you and craft a clean exploit if you need to inject some code into the target.</p> <p></p> <p>These are some of the basic core features and how they work for now.

I want to focus more on talking about the overall design of the two methods and the BIG flaws in them.</p> <p></p> <p>This article is a part of the new Danger! Series I’m launching, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p> <p>As always, any and all advanced versions of this article with a video guide if given will be for PAID patreon members only!!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "accessibility" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Accessibility vs Convenience in Cyber Security! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the biggest challenges we face when implementing new security features in an infrastructure is accessibility vs convenience, the overall means to implement a new security method while also making it convenient to use. </p> <p></p> <p>Accessibility allows the end user to easily understand and interpret/apply the new approach to security, allowing it to be seamlessly implemented into the security infrastructure in various ways. </p> <p></p> <p>This in return would require it to be more convenient in order to make it more accessible to them. Take token based MFA for example. All it is, is a simple pin code that is sent to the end user, so that they can input it into a system and authenticate on top of pre-existing knowledge factors that are set in place by default. For the sake of convenience, we have it set up so that the end user can receive the code in a variety of different ways: mobile SMS messages, email, authenticator apps, etc etc, various means spread out to allow them to use the method, which in the process, also makes it more accessible for them.</p> <p></p> <p>Sounds harmless right? WRONG. By making the method more convenient and accessible, we in fact increase the overall attack surface, making it more convenient and accessible for hackers to have options in order to exploit the security method that we’ve introduced. Don’t believe me? Check out my <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/danger-your-mobile-devices-vulnerable-roy-bull-futaba-webs--9u54e/?trackingId=OXrHkoIFT7mk8EkVhAcJkA%3D%3D&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3B7CUpqjxKRHaRgkH5R2N%2BAA%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;">“DANGER!Your Mobile Devices are VULNERABLE!”</a> article to learn about how one of these endpoints allows attackers to easily bypass the security method if needed. This of course, like all forms of MFA, varies depending on the layers that are within it. I’m of course ONLY talking about scenarios that involve the pin code method.</p> <p></p> <p>We need to be mindful that when implementing other endpoints for accessibility that can also apply the security method, we need to think several steps ahead, stuff like “is said endpoint secure enough to handle this feature?”, “what would happen in the event that it’s compromised”. We consistently get full of ourselves, thinking that the implementation of the method itself will suffice, that it is impenetrable, yet overlook the stuff like this, weaknesses that can turn it into rumble. </p> <p></p> <p>In terms of overall convenience, as harsh as this may sound, sometimes you need to limit how convenient it is to apply the method in order to ensure it's not easily exploitable. This can include from a wide range of stuff like either limiting how the user applies it, or, I some cases, how often the end user is required to use it, which leads into stuff like "Zero-Trust", which is a complex, yet secure form of security for any system infrastructure. I'll talk about that in another article. For now, let's stick to the main topic. </p> <p></p> <p>You can still make it more accessible and ensure that end users are able to use and implement it, but not TOO accessible if you see my main point? </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "argument" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Where am I going with this argument? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now, how does all of this apply to the topic up for discussion today? Well, believe it or not, SSO and OpenAuth, the main topic for today, as funny but not funny as this might sound, were MADE TO BE MORE CONVENIENT THAN IT IS SECURE. Don't believe me, well let me walk you through the overall concept of how these authentication methods function so that you see the point I’m trying to make. </p> <p></p> <p>Now, just to be CLEAR, I am NOT saying that whoever made this form of authentication method had the intention of NOT making it secure. I am simply just pointing out the major weaknesses in them based on how they were originally designed.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "sso">What is SSO (Single Sign On) 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Single sign on is the overall concept of being able to use ONE set of credentials to authenticate and log into multiple sessions with the same credentials that were used to authenticate to the first. Typically it’s used in infrastructures that have multiple sub layers or services that you would need to authenticate to. A good example of this would be WGU’s school system that deploys this method in order to allow you to authenticate to even your outlook mailbox with just your one session that you sign into the main student portal. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "openauth" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is OpenAuth 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This is a new form of authentication that is supposed to make sending over credentials a thing in the past, allowing you to basically send over passwordless credentials and authenticate to a system. This can also be done through mutual trusting parties such as the "Sign in with Google" option that you see on a lot of web applications that let you use your google log in session to authenticate.</p> <p></p> <p>This means that in theory if an attacker were to intercept a communication pipeline they would end up with nothing.</p> <p></p> <p>This method sounds lovely on paper, HOWEVER, there is one HUGE downfall to this… and why it needed some um… fixes cough requiring older security methods to patch it. It's one of the largest forms of a security breach waiting to happen. As a matter of fact it already has been. You can check a scenario on where OpenAuth is being used maliciously right <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/09/22/malicious-oauth-applications-used-to-compromise-email-servers-and-spread-spam/" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a> in order to infect and breach systems.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DangerSSOAndOpenAuth" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

In a sense you can think of this as a form of living off the land, where you are exploiting a trusted application within a system to gain and further extend access to a system infrastructure. The end goal of this method is much the same as many common attack vector end goals, RCE(remote code execution), which will allow you to botnet and control systems on the network further. </p> <p></p> <p>Hooking leads into stuff like DLL and Code injection which are used in order to hook and infect the memory pages of the target application, to launch malicious payloads from within the program itself. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "dll" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is DLL injection? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>DLL injection is the process of exploiting something that is known as a dynamic library, which are a series of core functions that are loaded alongside applications on startup for any and all general purposes. This is a trusted process that the system recognizes and allows the program to perform each time it runs. There are different types of DLL files, each one pertaining to a particular operating system: kernel32.dll for windows, ld. so. conf for linux, .dylib for MAC OS systems. </p> <p></p> <p>Essentially what we are doing using this injection method, is piggybacking off of the base address of where the DLL file is being loaded from on the system, in order to spoof our address as its address to come up as a legitimate process on the main system. This is also done on top of obfuscation methods to mask our activity on the system we are infecting. We need to blend in as much as possible in order to avoid being detected!</p> <p></p> <p>This allows us to mask in our own source code, which can be used in order to infect the system further.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "code" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Code injection 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Code injection is a much similar process much like DLL injection.

You can use either or to get the job done! If you get creative with it, you can nest in RCE commands, that also pipe in source code for you to infect the system with.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://www.patreon.com/posts/pentest-phases-102728942" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

Series I’m launching, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "overeliance" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Over reliance on one set of tools or methods is a PROBLEM! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the biggest flaws in today's modern Cyber Security is the over reliance on a set of security methods/tools that one assumes is FULL PROOF secure with ZERO weaknesses. </p> <p></p> <p>This leads to us letting our guard down, not planning further ahead on the various ways hackers could bypass our various security methods: technical, physical, and operational, preventing us from developing contingency plans that could back us up in case said series of options fail. Cyber Security, as I’ve said before, is a game of chess, one that requires you to be several steps ahead in order to defend our digital landscape. </p> <p></p> <p>For one to assume there is no weakness in a system, no matter how well sound it might be, is a CRITICAL mistake, one that plagues the industry today stares at the MITIRE company data breach. Know this well… THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A 100% SECURE SYSTEM. For as long as it is man made it will always contain some form of flaw or error in them. People are able to make mistakes, therefore, said programs will also reflect said mistakes.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "bypass" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! MAC Address filtering can be bypassed! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Mac address filtering involves configuring a network access point to only allow permitted devices to authenticate and access the internal network. In the event that an unauthorized user tries to access the internal network, the MAC address that is tied to their system will be checked and flagged by the security of the access point if it isn’t registered as a permitted device. </p> <p></p> <p>For most this would appear as a great form of security overall. Only the administrator that configured the MAC address cache for the access point will be able to see which MAC addresses you need in order to be permitted to the network. Solid right? WRONG!</p> <p></p> <p>Here is the major flaw with this setup….. There are 2 EASY ways to bypass this rule.</p> <p></p> <p>#1:</p> <p></p> <p>You can tap into the direct network feed if you find an open PHYSICAL network port. This also allows you to bypass any authentication methods that might be set in place even if you manage to spoof the MAC address through other means and get blocked by the WPA2 authentication process.</p> <p></p> <p>Even if you find the right MAC address, if they have a complex password to join the network, then you’re out of luck if you try to do this the wireless method and you can't crack the password. It is possible to bypass using just the MAC address alone, but like all forms of wireless security, it's constantly improving and evolving over time, making some of these methods hard if not IMPOSSIBLE to easily pull off.</p> <p></p> <p>Physical network taps, which typically do NOT require authentication, allows you to bypass this simple filter. </p> <p></p> <p>#2:</p> <p></p> <p>The MAC addresses for any and all systems that are connected to the internal network are sent out in data packets, via “stations” that are connected to the main access point. </p> <p></p> <p>With a simple tool like Aircrack-ng, you can use monitoring mode to sniff out all the data channels and see which systems are connected to the network to spoof any and all internal MAC addresses, allowing you to bypass the security and authenticate to the network. </p> <p></p> <p>Of course there are other means to do this, but these are methods that I have tried and have succeeded with that have allowed me to breach access points that I have personally setup for these types of tests.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "hiding" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! Hiding your SSID can be bypassed 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A common trick that a lot of people like to use in order to prevent unauthorized network breaches, is they like to hide their SSID’s which is the name of the network. This is effective in that you can hide SSID information from common means of exposure, like the GUI you use when selecting a wireless access point to communicate with.</p> <p></p> <p>The problem with this is it can easily be bypassed by the same method mentioned in option #2 of how to bypass MAC address filtering. </p> <p></p> <p>Your SSID is also broadcasted along with any and all MAC address information that is sent out in data packets. They have to be, otherwise our IoT devices would be unable to pick them up and identify them. THERE IS ALWAYS A WAY TO BYPASS ANYTHING! NOTHING IS 100 PERCENT SECURE!</p> <p></p> <p>Today’s positive bonuses will focus more on how to defend against MAC address filtering bypasses, preventing an attacker from breaching the network via this security method.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "hhttps://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DangerSSIDMACFILTERING" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

It's the overall process of enumerating the entire file system, and then applying what is known as symmetric cryptography in order to encrypt the entire data storage medium. A good example of this would be bitlocker, which is commonly used for Windows system infrastructures.</p> <p></p> <p>As you know, data encryption is irreversible without the crypto keys, so by performing this method and leaving the keys out the hands of the attacker, should they breach the system, whether it be digitally or physically, any and all data they steal will be useless to them.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "cookies" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What are COOKIES? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Symmetric cryptography, also known as single key cryptography, is the process of using a singular crypto key known as a private key in order to both encrypt as well as decrypt data. It's commonly more used for FDE over Asymmetric due to it being the faster encryption method.</p> <p></p> <p>This makes sense as the overall process for FDE is to enumerate THE ENTIRE file system ENTIRELY and encrypt EVERY single file on the system. Asymmetric would be too slow for this as it's a slower encryption standard. It's also commonly used in mobile device data encryption as well for the same reasons.</p> <p></p> <p>Asymmetric encryption on the other hand uses two crypto keys to perform the same process, except, in this case, it uses a public key for encryption, and a private key for decryption. The main reason for this is to add more secure complexity for various data communication methods. It’s also commonly used in stuff like PGP, pretty good privacy, which is commonly used for secure email data encryption.</p> <p></p> <p>One of the BIGGEST downfalls of symmetric data encryption is it's VULNERABLE to interception attacks. Should an attacker intercept the crypto key, they can: decrypt all data and messages, replay new ones on behalf of the original recipients, and a lot more.</p> <p></p> <p>However, with Asymmetric encryption, this isn't the case. Since it uses two crypto keys which come in pairs, Should a threat actor intercept the communication pipeline and steal one of the keys, their efforts will be in vain, as they lack one of the means to facilitate a SOLID man in the middle attack.</p> <p></p> <p>The whole premise of a man in the middle attack is to not only intercept the communication, but to reply messages on behalf of the respective parties. By using public key cryptography on top of other data channel splitting techniques, you render this the ineffective and leave them in a situation where they can’t facilitate it fully.</p> <p></p> <p>Should an attacker secure the public key only, then they'll only be able to send messages. They won't be able to read any of the data that is being sent back and forth, and any new messages will be suspected as false ones, which will lead to the replacing of the keys. Even if they verify with the key, it will all be for nothing.</p> <p></p> <p>However, in the event they have the private key, they'll be able to decrypt any and all messages, BUT, they won't be able to spoof and gain further insight and other information out of the communication pipeline. This is still a problem for them due to the fact most PKI infrastructures, even stuff like PGP, REQUIRE you to have the public key BEFORE you begin a communication to ensure message authenticity from the recipients. Simply not having the public key is like a lack of ID to verify who you are…. WHICH MEANS A DEAD PRIVATE KEY! This does vary depending on the infrastructure so do be mindful as I'm going over this.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "cookiehijacking" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Cookie Session Hijacking? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now that we've gone over the basics, let's talk about what Ransomware is.</p> <p></p> <p>Ransomware is basically FDE with malicious intent. It's a form of malware that is known as "crypto" malware, which deploys cryptographic techniques that enumerate the victims file system, exfiltrating data from it, and then encrypting the main copy of the data on the file system, rendering it useless to them. Be mindful that "crypto" malware and "ransomware" are TWO different forms of malware. Crypto malware is the main archetype, where as Ransomware is the child of said archetype, inheriting cryptographic techniques. </p> <p></p> <p>After the data is encrypted, a message is displayed to the end user requiring them to pay a "ransom" in order to receive the crypto keys to decrypt their data, hence the name "ransomware". The problem with this is paying the ransom doesn't guarantee you will receive the keys.</p> <p></p> <p>Ransomware is on the rise for being an effective attack method because it can be combined with phage malware techniques and phishing techniques to become SUPER effective.</p> <p></p> <p>Before, a simple click of the link or mishap in security meant you had an undetected botnet. NOW, it means all your data is encrypted and unreadable, which can be problematic if you're handling sensitive data that has to do with critical record information like someone's student or home loan payment information for example.</p> <p></p> <p>Mr.Robot for example, one of their biggest exploits in the show was encrypting all of E Corp's data in order to "FREE" everyone from debt. HOWEVER, it caused quite the opposite effect, where now people that were close to being debt free, or had funds in their bank accounts, were unable to access anything or prove what they've made payments due to the data being indecipherable. The result? TOTAL CHAOS where the people they were trying to “Free” suffered more.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/CookieSessionHijacking" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

The goal of the research project is to help educate small businesses run by women and other minority groups on proper Cyber Security practices. The QA was led by a woman named Grace Sommers. If you would like all the full in depth answers regarding the QA, you can find it on my patreon attached to the advanced version of this article. It's 9 pages and you can learn a lot about how to properly defend your digital systems from various attack vectors, including various endpoint security methods if that fancies you.</p> <p></p> <p>The more advanced version of this article is going to feature some more in depth techniques aside from the basic ones that will be discussed here today. As always, that will be for my patreon supporters only.</p> <p></p> <p>This article is a part of the Danger! Series, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p> <p></p> <p>Ransomware attacks are on the rise, and are a favorable attack method commonly used by a lot of crypto gangs. It's important to know how to protect yourself from these types of attacks. Ransomware, as shocking as this might sound, is EASY to stop, rather, easy to render useless. It's simply a matter of understanding the critical flaw within the attack method itself and what it relies on to execute.</p> <p></p> <p>Even with all of this you still need to know proper data mitigation techniques, since the attack method also focuses on data exfiltration. I'm going to teach you various mitigation strategies that not only protect you from ransomware attacks, BUT, protect various data endpoints to prevent exfiltration. Why? Even if you render a ransomware attack from crippling your infrastructure, the attacker STILL got away with sensitive data which they can use as they please. You need to observe all the little things to see the bigger picture.</p> <p></p> <p>I'll also be covering some basic stuff like FDE, cryptography, etc, so that you FULLY understand how the attack method works. Pay close attention to the cryptography stuff since you NEED to understand how it works, both from the perspective of a threat actor, as well as from an overall security standpoint perspective.</p> <p></p> <p>If you would like a demonstration of the technique, I wrote an article demonstrating how to write the code and perform the technique, as well as a live demonstration that can be found on my YouTube channel. If you would like to see the sample code for it, you can find it in my "Python-Pen-Testing-Tools" in my main Github Repository <a href = "https://github.com/RoyMBull/Python-Pen-Testing-Tools/blob/main/Python%20PenTesting%20Tools/Ransomeware.py" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "fde" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is FDE (Full disk encryption)? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Before we dive into what Ransomware is, let's go over what FDE is, since it heavily applies to the topic for today.</p> <p></p> <p>FDE, full disk encryption, is a defensive technique that is used to harden data protection across all hierarchical flat file systems. It's the overall process of enumerating the entire file system, and then applying what is known as symmetric cryptography in order to encrypt the entire data storage medium. A good example of this would be bitlocker, which is commonly used for Windows system infrastructures.</p> <p></p> <p>As you know, data encryption is irreversible without the crypto keys, so by performing this method and leaving the keys out the hands of the attacker, should they breach the system, whether it be digitally or physically, any and all data they steal will be useless to them.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "crypto" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Symmetric/Asymmetric Cryptography? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Symmetric cryptography, also known as single key cryptography, is the process of using a singular crypto key known as a private key in order to both encrypt as well as decrypt data. It's commonly more used for FDE over Asymmetric due to it being the faster encryption method.</p> <p></p> <p>This makes sense as the overall process for FDE is to enumerate THE ENTIRE file system ENTIRELY and encrypt EVERY single file on the system. Asymmetric would be too slow for this as it's a slower encryption standard. It's also commonly used in mobile device data encryption as well for the same reasons.</p> <p></p> <p>Asymmetric encryption on the other hand uses two crypto keys to perform the same process, except, in this case, it uses a public key for encryption, and a private key for decryption. The main reason for this is to add more secure complexity for various data communication methods. It’s also commonly used in stuff like PGP, pretty good privacy, which is commonly used for secure email data encryption.</p> <p></p> <p>One of the BIGGEST downfalls of symmetric data encryption is it's VULNERABLE to interception attacks. Should an attacker intercept the crypto key, they can: decrypt all data and messages, replay new ones on behalf of the original recipients, and a lot more.</p> <p></p> <p>However, with Asymmetric encryption, this isn't the case. Since it uses two crypto keys which come in pairs, Should a threat actor intercept the communication pipeline and steal one of the keys, their efforts will be in vain, as they lack one of the means to facilitate a SOLID man in the middle attack.</p> <p></p> <p>The whole premise of a man in the middle attack is to not only intercept the communication, but to reply messages on behalf of the respective parties. By using public key cryptography on top of other data channel splitting techniques, you render this the ineffective and leave them in a situation where they can’t facilitate it fully.</p> <p></p> <p>Should an attacker secure the public key only, then they'll only be able to send messages. They won't be able to read any of the data that is being sent back and forth, and any new messages will be suspected as false ones, which will lead to the replacing of the keys. Even if they verify with the key, it will all be for nothing.</p> <p></p> <p>However, in the event they have the private key, they'll be able to decrypt any and all messages, BUT, they won't be able to spoof and gain further insight and other information out of the communication pipeline. This is still a problem for them due to the fact most PKI infrastructures, even stuff like PGP, REQUIRE you to have the public key BEFORE you begin a communication to ensure message authenticity from the recipients. Simply not having the public key is like a lack of ID to verify who you are…. WHICH MEANS A DEAD PRIVATE KEY! This does vary depending on the infrastructure so do be mindful as I'm going over this.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "ransomware" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Ransomware? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now that we've gone over the basics, let's talk about what Ransomware is.</p> <p></p> <p>Ransomware is basically FDE with malicious intent. It's a form of malware that is known as "crypto" malware, which deploys cryptographic techniques that enumerate the victims file system, exfiltrating data from it, and then encrypting the main copy of the data on the file system, rendering it useless to them. Be mindful that "crypto" malware and "ransomware" are TWO different forms of malware. Crypto malware is the main archetype, where as Ransomware is the child of said archetype, inheriting cryptographic techniques. </p> <p></p> <p>After the data is encrypted, a message is displayed to the end user requiring them to pay a "ransom" in order to receive the crypto keys to decrypt their data, hence the name "ransomware". The problem with this is paying the ransom doesn't guarantee you will receive the keys.</p> <p></p> <p>Ransomware is on the rise for being an effective attack method because it can be combined with phage malware techniques and phishing techniques to become SUPER effective.</p> <p></p> <p>Before, a simple click of the link or mishap in security meant you had an undetected botnet. NOW, it means all your data is encrypted and unreadable, which can be problematic if you're handling sensitive data that has to do with critical record information like someone's student or home loan payment information for example.</p> <p></p> <p>Mr.Robot for example, one of their biggest exploits in the show was encrypting all of E Corp's data in order to "FREE" everyone from debt. HOWEVER, it caused quite the opposite effect, where now people that were close to being debt free, or had funds in their bank accounts, were unable to access anything or prove what they've made payments due to the data being indecipherable. The result? TOTAL CHAOS where the people they were trying to “Free” suffered more.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "strategy" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What should you do during a Ransomware Attack? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the biggest misconceptions about ransomware attacks, a common question that gets asked, is what do you do in the event of a ransomware data breach? This is a VERY bad question to ask, as it under prepares many business infrastructures on how to deal with actual ransomware threats.</p> <p></p> <p>The real practical question to ask is what do you do BEFORE a ransomware attack occurs? Still scratching your head? Let me explain.</p> <p></p> <p>You see, in the event that a ransomware attack connects, THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO!!!! Ransomware is an IRREVERSIBLE process, where unless you have the crypto keys, which are in the hands of the attacker, there is NOTHING you can do. Even if you pay the ransom, you're not guaranteed to be given the crypto keys to re-acquire the data that has been stolen. You also have loads of fines that stack along with the ransomware breach that you are required to report on top of that.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "mitigation" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the simplest means to prevent damage from this type of attack? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the SIMPLEST yet COMMONLY ignored methods to prevent ransomware from being super effective BEFORE it strikes is the usage of constant data backups. There are two main types: inferential and differential backups.</p> <p></p> <p>Differential backups are full backups where you backup any and all data across the board. This is done at certain time frames regularly to back up large quantities of data at a time.</p> <p></p> <p>Incremental backups are partial backups where you backup portions of data at a time. This is common practice on top of the differential one as you'll often have a case where certain portions of data need to be backed up. Think of it like this, if you modified a file on your flash drive, would you back up the entire drive again? Doesn't make sense right? This is where you would apply this method.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DangerRansomware" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

I'll even cover one of the best FREE beginner tools that you can use to apply the technique in a more automated fashion.</p> <p></p> <p>If you would like to see how to perform remote file inclusion, as well as the best means to do so, then I suggest checking out this video <a href = "https://www.patreon.com/posts/lab-python-104381028" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a> from my patreon lab for the TCPBackdoor exploit.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "remote" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Remote File inclusion? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Remote file inclusion is the process of directly uploading malicious files/payloads to a remote web application server in order to have it become a part of the main file archives that belong to it.. This allows the threat actor to infect and or control the web application on a massive scale, as well as deliver unsuspecting payloads to end users that use said service. If done correctly. it can lead to the compromising of many end user networks and IoT devices if not mitigated correctly.</p> <p></p> <p>As you know, web application servers use the HTTP/HTTPS protocol to host various html files that end users can access through the internet on behalf of a web browser application. When you visit a website, you're auto directed to the main HTML index page welcoming you to the site. From there the end user browses the site through the main UI(user interface) which will allow them to view any and all HTML pages that are hosted on the web application, as well as any other fields that might be included with it.</p> <p></p> <p>Web applications, as I’ve mentioned earlier, host various other files that are accessible to the end user, like executables, that are auto downloaded to their system the moment they visit the resource location on the server.</p> <p></p> <p>For example: https://website[.]com/Download.exe (JUST AN EXAMPLE! IT'S NOT REAL)</p> <p></p> <p>When you visit this link, it will download a file that is known simply as "Download.exe". Much like how when you visit an HTML page, it's automatically displayed and interpreted on the screen for you, downloadable non HTML files are auto downloaded to your system for you to use.</p> <p></p> <p>Remote file inclusion exploits both of these things discussed about web applications in 2 ways.</p> <p></p> <p>#1, it can host fake pages and replace the pre-existing ones with spoofed pages that are malicious.</p> <p></p> <p>Ever heard of a website that was hacked, and suddenly all the "legitimate" web pages on it were now all malicious and infected end user systems? Well this is how REAL threat actors go about it when they compromise a web application.</p> <p></p> <p>By exploiting this vulnerability in a LEGITIMATE web application, you not only trick the web browser and security in place to protect the end user from spoofed sites, BUT, you also trick the end user into visiting pages that are malicious, allowing them to steal sensitive credentials, and even land a botnet onto the end user network should they want to extend their overall attack surface.</p> <p></p> <p>#2, it can be used to host executables that are auto downloaded to the victim's system</p> <p></p> <p>It's no shocker that one of the bread and butters for a threat actor is to use this technique to host malicious payloads that are auto downloaded to the victim's system. This can be deadly if it's a majorly trusted executable whose signature is also spoofed and ran on the target system.</p> <p></p> <p>Imagine VSCode, a desktop application that is commonly trusted and downloaded onto millions of systems daily, suddenly replaced with a fake version that was trusted by any and all end user systems? This would lead to a massive breach on many systems, as it's also possible for an attacker to spoof the signature of the software to bypass security. They can even do stuff like DLL and Code injection, as well as many obfuscation techniques to go undetected. The list goes on with the amount of creativity and devastating dama that can be done should an attacker land this critical flaw against a well trusted system</p> <p></p> <p>#3 it can allow you to pull of RCE and directory traversal</p> <p></p> <p>If you manage to pop a php file to a web application, you basically have a remote backdoor into the system that you can tap into whenever you need to and further extend your reach to the network the web application is hosted on.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "local" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is local file inclusion? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Local file inclusion, also known as directory traversal, is a technique that allows you to browse the web application's file system. This isn't a form of RCE no, BUT, it does allow you to browse stuff that is outside the bounds of the web application root directory.</p> <p></p> <p>As mentioned before, when you visit a web application you are accessing the HTML files via the file system of the web application.</p> <p></p> <p>For security reasons, in order to prevent you from accessing files outside those bounds, you are prohibited from being able to view anything that is not a part of the main web application root directory that is configured for it.</p> <p></p> <p>Directory traversal bypasses this security and allows you to access any and all files that are sensitive on the system.</p> <p></p> <p>This can also lead to RCE because should you, in the event there is an open SSH service for example, should you happen to find the credentials to connect with the right privileges, you can extend your attack surface.</p> <p></p> <p>You can also view any and all sensitive files to gain access to password data that can allow you to compromise any services that are tied to the web application, such as the administrative credentials for login pages if they happen to be there.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "difference" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The difference between the two? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The biggest overall difference between remote file inclusion and local file inclusion, is that remote file inclusion is more you uploading and or replacing legitimate files on the web application to infect it.</p> <p></p> <p>Local file inclusion is more used to browse the system to find sensitive files and or credentials. You can exploit this in various ways, even through programs on the file system that print text data from various files in the web application system.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "rce" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is RCE? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>RCE, RCE, RCE! You’ve been hearing me say this a lot, but I haven’t quite yet explained what it means right? </p> <p></p> <p>RCE, remote code execution, is the main goal and bread and butter for any and all forms of injection exploits against any system. It's commonly applied to various things: buffer overflows via obfuscated malware, remote code execution, SQL injection, etc. It’s also just a common end game for any form of breach. </p> <p></p> <p>Your end goal is to always find a way to RCE a system in order to control it directly via shell code commands, which can be combined with various coding techniques to deal more damage.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/RemoteLocalFileInclusion" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

This is where you get crafty and make one yourself. It comes in handy for a lot of practical applications that allow you to mix it up with past techniques I’ve shown you, and apply stuff that even apache2 and nginx servers aren’t designed to do. Be mindful, I'm not saying you should drop the apache2 setup.

It’s also portable, so if you happen to snapshot the system, you can carry it to another VM of the same type and then pop it there. </p> <p></p> <p>Windows Recall is a part of the main Windows Copilot Runtime , which is an AI based API.</p> <p></p> <p>It relies on the User Activity API, which is a C# focused API, in order to create screenshots and encapsulate sessions that have to do with the end user data that is on the system: Overall user activity, data, data accounts, as well as any and all tasks that were running on the main system at the time.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "screenshot" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a system screenshot? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>System screenshots, often performed for virtual machines, is a mechanic that allows you to screenshot the entire state of the local system from all various endpoints: memory, tasks, running browser sessions and any cookie data with it, etc. </p> <p></p> <p>Think of it like “quick save” when you are playing a video game. Once you reach a certain checkpoint, OR, after a certain period of time, the game will “save” itself, in which, depending on the game, you can go back in time and pick up where you left off. </p> <p></p> <p>System snapshots is also a technique that is commonly used for forensics purposes, weather it be maliciously or defensively. It can be used, for example, to retrieve crypto keys that are often stored in memory while during live run time of the system. This can be vital for data recovery purposes in case you lost the keys, OR, in the eyes of an attacker, it can be used to decrypt any and al sensitive data with it to compromise a system infrastructure. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "caution" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">CAUTION! READ FIRST! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Since Windows Recall is fairly new, these are just theories on how it can be exploited, which is not fully set in stone until people exploit it (which many have done so already). </p> <p></p> <p>Feel free to theorize and let me know various other ways this feature can be exploited and drop a comment in the comments section bellow. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "negative" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! Recall renders data sanitation INEFFECTIVE!? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Windows Recall renders stuff like data sanitation methods on the system useless.</p> <p></p> <p>Wiped a few crpyo keys for proper toss the key method? Recall will help threat actors restore the system so they can retrieve it!</p> <p></p> <p>Deleted files and purged them from the system so no one could view them and have a digital certificate verifying the wipe? RECALL WILL HELP THREAT ACTORS RESTORE THE SYSTEM SO THEY CAN RETRIEVE IT!</p> <p></p> <p>See where I'M going with this? No matter what you do, threat actors are able to essentially go back in time and revert the process since the main state of the system has been PERFECTLY saved in memory. At this point it's also a forensics tool for hackers in this case for data retrieval. </p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DangerSSIDMACFILTERING" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

As always, this will be for paid patreon members only. </p> <p></p> <p>For this article, we are ONLY going to talk about some of the basic ones you should know first: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE</p> <p></p> <p>Any other ones mentioned later on will be for paid patreon members only.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "http" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What are HTTP methods? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>HTTP methods are a series of request types that tell the backend of the server to perform a said action, and then interact with the client in a certain way. How each one works varies depending on the one that you are using.</p> <p></p> <p>The default HTTP methods that we are going to cover today are.</p> <p></p> <p>🎃GET</p> <p>🎃HEAD</p> <p>🎃POST</p> <p>🎃PUT</p> <p>🎃DELETE</p> <p>🎃CONNECT</p> <p>🎃OPTIONS</p> <p>🎃TRACE</p> <p>🎃PATCH</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "get" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the GET HTTP request? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The GET HTTP method, the default one that is commonly used in any and all HTTP servers, is used in order to fetch data from resources on the HTTP file system. </p> <p></p> <p>For example, when you enter “https:// google [.] com”, your web browser will send over a GET request to the HTTP server in order to load the page you want to view.</p> <p></p> <p>It can also be used to fetch stuff like executables or files that are on the HTTP server that you wish to also download. </p> <p></p> <p>It’s also common for input parameter fields, like searching a website for products on the page you wish to purchase. When you enter in the name of an item you want to purchase, a GET request is made to the backend of the server, in which it will perform a database query that will retrieve the elements form the database, placing it in the given fields where the main web application wishes to present them to you.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, when you search “cats”, in lets say a website for example, the main HTTP GET request, as well as the name of the item you are searching for is processed by the backend that will allow GET requests, parsing it, and piping in a request like so</p> <p></p> <p>“SELECT makeup FROM makeuptable WHERE Product_ID=”YOUR_INPUT”. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "post" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the POST HTTP request? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The POST HTTP method is commonly used in scenarios where the HTTP server needs to handle user input data and submit it, like login data for example, or any kind of data that needs to be processed by the backend in order to perform a specific action. The backend handles said data, and then processes it to the system for a variety of purposes: resources directly on the file system, database queries, etc. </p> <p></p> <p>It can also be used to upload stuff like files for remote file inclusion for example. </p> <p></p> <p>It can also be used for simple retrieval purposes if needed to, but the main purpose of the request is to do what I just mentioned.</p> <p></p> <p>Threat actors commonly exploit the POST HTTP method in order to perform a variety of server side attacks, since, depending on how the backend of the HTTP server is configured to handle the processed data, they can manipulate the system in a variety of unique ways: SQL injection, Command injection, Cross Site Scripting, etc. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "put" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the PUT HTTP request? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The PUT HTTP method is used in order to modify and update resources that are already on the HTTP server file system. </p> <p></p> <p>It can also be used, depending on how the PUT request method is programmed for the backend, be used to add an entirely new resource to the system itself. </p> <p></p> <p>I say this strongly because, one of the obvious things to do as a security professional would be to ONLY allow it to update resources which is what it’s designed to do.</p> <p></p> <p>If a threat actor finds a way to pull this HTTP method off, they can basically remotely include as many files as they want to the server and exploit the system in a variety of ways. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "delete" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the POST HTTP request? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The DELETE HTTP method is the opposite of the PUT HTTP request method, where instead of adding or updating files/resources on the main file system, it instead REMOVES them from the file system. </p> <p></p> <p>For this one, since it’s obvious, you can wrap your head around what’ll happen if an attacker is able to pull this off.</p> <p></p> <p>This can be CRUCIAL for stuff like modifications to an end user account, when you change stuff like your username for example, as well as various aspects of information that need SPECIFIC ways of being updated on the HTTP server file system, that might or might not have to do with the end user specifically. </p> <p></p> <p>It sounds a bit complicated, but try to process the example I’ve just mentioned</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/HTTPRequestsMethods" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

It’s one of the biggest reasons in the event of a real situation where there is a threat to the safety of others concerning certain forms of data, business infrastructures refuse to disclose it unless there is a certain process they undergo to safely do so. </p> <p></p> <p>This article is a part of the Danger! Series, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advanced version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "csam" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is CSAM? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>CSAM is “Child Sexual Abuse Material '', which is any form of sexually explicit inappropriate content regarding adolescents and kids overall. Think (DON’T ACTUALLY THINK!!) of it like “porn” but for pedophiles. It can be collected and fabricated in various ways. </p> <p></p> <p>This form of content is HIGHLY illegal, where often times it’s fabrication results in the sexual assault and abuse of actual children to make it. There are even human trafficking operations where children are explicitly kidnapped for these purposes on top of other things. </p> <p></p> <p>Due to its nature, a lot of underground activity for it occurs on the dark net in order to serve it to its ahem… “high” following fanbase. </p> <p></p> <p>There have also been other means to fabricate it such as A.I for example, which can turn pictures of children into sexually inappropriate content, or even create said content out of whatever data is available to them even if it doesn't involve actual pictures of children. </p> <p></p> <p>CSAM has also gotten to the point where Kids are being harassed and extored online into sending this type of content to predators, which has lead to the deaths of many via suicide.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "e2e" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is End to End (E2E) Encryption? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the main topics for today is to talk about the dangers of E2E encryption, and how it’s being used by companies to “turn a blind eye” to CSAM cases. </p> <p></p> <p>This form of encryption, although it sounds good on paper, has LOTS of fatal flaws depending on WHERE and HOW it’s used. In the event of something basic like PGP for emails or a PKI system, where public and private crypto keys are being used to exchange data for business infrastructures, this is harmless. There are also means to strip the network traffic should it be necessary for security within the infrastructure.</p> <p></p> <p>In the event of how certain social media platforms implement it: Meta, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc. it can be a deadly tool to allow platforms that CHILDREN operate on to be vulnerable to sex extortion cases and can be a means for servicing CSAM material.</p> <p></p> <p>End to End encryption's biggest enabler for CSAM, is that NO THIRD PARTIES are able to intercept and view ANY of the traffic that is being sent between various main parties, including THE COMPANY THEMSELVES.</p> </br> </br></br> <h4 id = "social" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">E2E allows social media platforms to turn a blind eye to CSAM! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Ever noticed what the ruckus was when platforms like meta implemented end to end data encryption? </p> <p></p> <p>It’s not due to the fact it’s being used to secure end user text messages and data, which would be a good thing if only the case. </p> <p></p> <p>The PROBLEM is these types of platforms cater to both adults and CHILDREN! They can coexist and interact with each other at the same time. Even with stuff like messenger for kids, it’s still possible to make a dummy account and interact with children.</p> <p></p> <p>With end to end encryption, pedophiles and other forms of cyber criminal activity can go left unnoticed, or to better phrase it, “indecipherable’</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DangerE2E" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

It’s an abundance of FREE knowledge, one that if you know how to use it, you’ll become one of the most skilled and dangerous hackers of all time. Think of the Metasploit as all your “past lives”. You have access to all of that information. You just need to learn how to use it properly. </p> <p></p> <p>This article will of course be video oriented, and will only be available to PAID patreon members only. </p> <p></p> <p>It’s no shocker that it’s a staple tool in every hacker’s tool belt, but shockingly enough, due to how times have changed, I don’t quite see it picked up by newcomers or talked about enough anymore. I know it still sees light and people use it, but nowadays I rarely hear anyone post or even talk about it, and it’s one of the standard tools much like aircrack-ng. People forget that a lot of newer tools are based on the original ones that are known and loved by the hacker community.</p> <p></p> <p>Recently one of my favorite authors ran into an issue where someone thought recommending Aircrack-NG was a horrible idea due to how old it is, when it is in face one of THE best pentesting tools hands down to seamlessly crack various wireless encryption: WEP, WPA, WPA2, etc. Even most pentesting methodologies or tools mimic it in some shape or format just like with metasploit.</p> <h4 id = "metasploit">What is Metasploit? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Metasploit is an offensive security penetration testing framework that can be used for a variety of penetration testing methodologies: web application, networking, C&C/botneting, mobile hacking, etc. It’s a multi-tool power house in case you haven’t noticed, and has left a legacy, where tools like SET, routersploit and even kali nethunter mimic in terms of overall terminal functional and design. It also has one of the best well maintained database archives of any and all exploits that exist in its database. The code written and stored in it is beyond our deserving.</p> <p></p> <p>Metasploit is also both an easy to use tool for beginners as well as a complex tool for more advanced folks in the hacking community, one that can require a bit of skill to use effectively. It’s also one of THE most maintained tools that you could ever pick up, as most tools, even if they’re super good and practical, lack support and maintenance, EVEN, if they happen to surpass it overall in functionality. It helps even more as most of the stuff is already there so no need to reinvent the wheel, just build on top of it, which many have like I’ve said before. </p> <p></p> <p>I’m going to talk about some of the opinions that you’ll see in the framework and what they mean as it can be quite confusing. </p> <h4 id = "aux">Auxiliary Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>If you’ve noticed in my hacking with Shodan exploit guide, you’ll notice that when I use the shodan module, in the module address in the metasploit framework, the first part of the address begins with “auxiliary”, which indicates that that the module you are using is a form of information gathering tool. </p> <p></p> <p>You can use various auxiliary tools in metasploit for various purposes: port scanning, OSNIT, etc. </p> </br> <h4 id = "exploit">Exploit Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the most commonly well known module formats in metasploit, the exploit module, is basically an auto pwn exploit, where you simply need to pass in the coordinates, or configuration: IP, port, any word lists depending on the module, etc, and the tool set will do ti’s thing.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, for setting up reverse TCP shells, you have the classic exploit/multi-handler module which allows you to set up a multi purpose server that can be set to work with: linux, mac, and windows payloads, and auto pwn the system should you get the executable up and running on it. </p> </br> <h4 id = "payloads">Payloads 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Payloads are an interesting feature, as MANY don’t quite understand how to use them properly.</p> <p></p> <p>Payloads are basically the malicious code or executable that you’d often have to use mfvenom for in order to generate them, along with setting them inside exploit modules like with hacking mobile devices to get them up and running. </p> <p></p> <p>They are standalone and need to be delivered to the target in order for them to work. How you go about that is all up to you. </p> <p></p> <p> Next, I’m also going to also go over some other stuff you ONLY do with the msfvenom feature that is a part of the metasploit framework: encoders, evasion, etc.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/metasploit" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

Of course whistles I’m just theorizing. It’s not like I’ve been paid to do this stuff before right haha…. cricket noises.. AHEM… back to the point of the matter!</p> <p></p> <p>I’m also going to talk about what SPOF is since it’s a CRITICAL topic that you’ll often come across in Cyber and Information security, WHICH YOU NEED TO KNOW. It’s so important that simply not knowing it is one of the MAIN reasons why we have so many security breaches and bad Cyber Security practices. </p> <p></p> <p>Lastly, since this is of course the danger series, I am going to address MANY remedies that can be done in order to enhance your overall network security, most of which you probably have never thought of in the first place. I’ve played around with a lot of this stuff, so do take my word for it. </p> <p></p> <p>This article is a part of the Danger! Series, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "wap" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a WAP? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>WAP, which stands for wireless access points, are the various gateway networking devices that we use to access various local networks including the internet: routers, hubs, switches, etc. They host various endpoint devices: laptops, desktops, mobile devices, CCTV systems, that are able to communicate with each other on the network via various networking protocols like TCP/IP for example, allowing them to exchange various data packets in order to communicate. Think of WAP’s, in the case of this article, like your “house”, where you are trying to “protect” it. You still following me? Good!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "spof" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is SPOF 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>SPOF, which stands for Single Point of Failure is when one endpoint or vulnerability leads to a SIGNIFICANT compromise of a multitude of systems in an infrastructure(s). </p> <p></p> <p>For example, the common element of a human factor via phishing and social engineering. It doesn't matter how many security factors you have at play, if even ONE person screws up and lets the threat actor in, then it is all for naught, hence it is a SPOF.</p> <p></p> <p>Let’s try another factor, but this time a bit more technical. Let’s say you happen to have multiple endpoints with application systems on them facing each other, many of which have access to each other's resources, even the most critical ones. In the event should ONE of these systems, or even if it were a singular system that was connected to everything in the same manner, it would lead to a MASSIVE SPOF that could do some heavy damage to the infrastructure. </p> <p></p> <p>Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, let’s dive into the main dangers that could happen should a your WAP happen to be compromised. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "hackers" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Your WAP aid’s hackers 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Anonymity is one of the biggest assets for a threat actor. It allows them to go undetected and remain untraced. There are NUMEROUS ways to go about this: burner phones, burner laptops, tor, FREE wifi spots, etc, BUT, did you know that YOUR AP(Access Point) can be used as a means to allow threat actors to keep their anonymity. </p> <p></p> <p>Now this doesn’t sound too bad right? Someone wants to use your wifi without your consent, not a big deal! WRONG! It becomes a HUGE deal when what they are doing is being traced back to YOUR location and IP address. Even if you are innocent, if the odds are law enforcement tracks back malicious activity to your IP address you suddenly are thrown under the bus by something you didn’t do. </p> <p></p> <p>Everything I’m saying is a COMMON tactic that hackers use to stay off the radar. If you use someone elses WIFI, it even let’s you do the one thing threat actors should NEVER do, which is hack from the comfort of your own home.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DangerWAP" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

BUT, don’t be misled by what you see on paper. Not everything translates well. </p> <p></p> <p>The main overall goal of A.I., which stands for “Artificial intelligence”, as I’ve mentioned, is to serves to overall be a replication of human intelligence. That’s the goal of computing technology overall, as we’ve quite LITERALLY tricked an actual rock into THINKING… AND IT WORKED. Computing technology is supposed to be an extension as well as amplification of the human intellect and capabilities. So far we have computers that are able to follow instructions and perform tasks with 100 percent accuracy and proficiency at incomprehensible speeds…. just as long as it’s been programmed to do so CORRECTLY of course. The big downside of this, as impressive as this might all sound….. Is it’s NOT actual HUMAN intelligence. It is just an imitation of it. The problem with A.I. is we’ve falsely assumed we’ve surpassed human intelligence when we couldn’t be further from the truth. We haven’t even replicated it, yet we seem to think we’ve reached a new era of utopia where it’s far surpassed us. We’ve still got a long way to go. </p> <p></p> <p>I’m also going to talk about why I don’t like A.I., which is mostly due to the FALSE image that it has implanted in our minds and WHY I’m enjoying it’s slow and inevitable downfall. I’m a HUGE tech enthusiast, and am VERY open minded to many implementations of it. Tech has advanced society to limits that I wouldn’t have imagine possible, which also lead to it HELPING a lot of people overall, as well as made things more accessible for the disabled: prosthetics, eye care, hearing impaired, etc, the list goes on. Typically technology BENEFITS EVERYONE and has a POSITIVE effect (ahem… I know what you’re thinking just go with it haha), but in the case of A.I, it has lead to the false impression of a utopia that simply WILL NEVER EXIST! One where the robots will do all the work for us so we can just sit back and relax and prosper from it. We looked only at the short term of A.I. and not the long term, and because of that, we are PAYING a hefty price for it. It’s being used to REPLACE us, NOT HELP US. </p> <p></p> <p>Lastly, I’ll also be covering a few HUGE security risks and COPY right laws that come into factor regarding it. </p> <p></p> <p>This article is a part of the Danger! Series, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent.

Think of it like raising a child, and slowly educating it over the years. The human brain has the learning capacity to retain experiences far and wise no matter how much time has passed, which is what we are trying to simulate. This is also what is commonly known as Machine Learning. One of the most commonly used programming languages for data structures is poses and brags PYTHON.</p> <p></p> <p>There is a HUGE flaw to this and I’ll discuss it shortly.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "jobs" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How A.I. has impacted the Job Market? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>As you might have noticed over the past 2 years so far, roles in tech, especially with software dev and Cyber, which pay the most, have taken a HUGE dive and have been experiencing MASSIVE layoffs and reduction in overall workforce size for various infrastructures. There are many financial factors that lead to this, but one of the most influential ones that I am going to discuss today has to do with the introduction of A.I.</p> <p></p> <p>A.I. has introduced the concept of automated work, which is a form of utopia that many have been craving for for a while now, essentially computers and other forms of machinery doing all the leg work for us while we just sit back and relax. In a perfect world, this would be wonderful. HOWEVER… the world doesn’t work like that.</p> <p></p> <p>What has been happening is businesses have been incorporating A.I. to essentially replace staff members due to the impression that A.I. can now do all of the work for us. This is due to a topic which I’ll discuss next.</p> <p></p> <p>This has overall left many out of work and in fear of being replaced by A.I. which so far has been the case, but is slowly coming to a standstill due to the obvious reasons, which I’ll dive more into next.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DANGER_AI" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

Think of it as a flying wifi-pineapple. When the drone boots up, the pi zero will auto login, where a set of scripts will run, starting up the UDP Server. </br> </br> The flight controller for the drone is built up from scratch, rather than using a pre-built one. The drone will take a series of commands from the transmitter, the controller, also built from scratch (keyboard input option available as well), and depending on the value read from the analog of the joystick module, will move the drone either: forward, backward, left, right, up down, and shifts the values of the signal values sent to the ESC's of the drone in order to move the drone accordingly, all calibrated properly. The drone is still in prototype phase, and is near completion. </br> </br> In the future I will be diving into how to facial recognition software, which I will build from scratch in order to build a true replica of Wrench from Watch Dogs 2, his face mask that acts as a build board, where his facial expressions are scanned by the mask in order to display a a set of emojis that show his emotions. </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://github.com/RoyMBull/Pen-Testing-Drone-Prototype" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid"> <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-block" style = "background-color: purple; font-weight: bold; color: black; border-color: black;" > Click to View More </button> </div> </a>`;

When end users search anything on your site, it performs a query that retrieves data from the database that’s linked to your web application, stuff like: generic data, PII payment information, and a lot more. If you’re not careful, then threat actors can inject malicious code into the search bar that allows them to access more information than they should. This could lead to potential massive credential dumps, OR, them having the ability to either escalate privileges to admin or initiate themselves as administrators.</p> </br></br> <p>🎃 Local and Remote File inclusions</p></br> <p> Where I’ll test file uploads on your website to make sure threat actors can’t upload malicious code that could lead to backdoors being placed on your servers. If you’re not careful, threat actors could potentially upload malware that influences the entire backend of your site. They could do stuff like: replace legitimate pages with spoofed ones, perform privilege escalation, establish remote backdoors that allow them to pivot beyond the scope of where your web application is hosted, and a lot more. Ensuring these tests are done ensures the security and integrity behind your web application. </p> </br></br> <p>🎃 Session Hijacking & Cross Site Forgery</p></br> <p> Where I’ll test to see if there are any stuff like cookies and session tokens for example that don’t expire. Threat actors can exploit any means of remembering the end users session to hijack and gain access. </p> </br></br> <p>🎃 Cross Site Scripting</p> </br> <p> Where I’ll test to see if your site is vulnerable to scripts being injected on any of the pages. If you’re not careful, and should stuff like forum or comment sections be exploitable, it could lead to scripts that could potentially harm the end user being masqueraded on the page. It could lead to stuff like: keyloggers that track the end users keystrokes, as well as stuff like cookies being stolen which can pivot into session hijacking. </p> </br></br> <p>🎃 Login Security and Bruteforce testing</p></br> <p> Where I’ll test to see if your site is vulnerable to scripts being injected on any of the pages. If you’re not careful, and should stuff like forum or comment sections be exploitable, it could lead to scripts that could potentially harm the end user being masqueraded on the page.

It could lead to stuff like: keyloggers that track the end users keystrokes, as well as stuff like cookies being stolen which can pivot into session hijacking. </p> </br></br> <p>As well as fuzzing and other various forms of Unicode parameter based methods and a lot more!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; font-size: 30px;">🎃 What You’ll Do? 🎃</h4></br> <p>🎃 Forward me the overall scope for the Pentest and what I need to test for.

This is extra in terms of fees if you go about it this way.</p> </br> <p>🎃 Give me a reasonable deadline to test against your site.

Book a session with me to see if there are any security issues on your network.</p> </br> <p>I’ll check for stuff like</p> </br></br> <p>🎃 Redundant systems</p> </br> <p> Which can lead to inactive systems that are trusted on the network being turned into bots. This allows threat actors to bypass internal security, infecting other systems, and even taking it further to perform living off the land advanced tactics where they utilize trusted software on your systems in order to compromise your internal infrastructure. You need to be careful about what you have on your network. I can check for what you do and don’t need and point you in the right direction.</p> </br></br> <p>🎃 Proper Port forwarding</p> </br> <p>If it’s an onsite job, I’ll test to see if your switched network applies proper port forwarding security. Port forwarding allows each individual port on your switched network to be assigned to a specific machine via network tap, blocking off access for threat actors, since in order for them to gain access they’d need to figure out the MAC address of the system assigned to it. Physical bypasses are one of the first things threat actors look for during a physical breach. It bypasses the need for a password to access the network and allows them to easily tap into network traffic not only for themselves, but for other systems on your network. </p> </br></br> <p>🎃 Proper subnetting implementation</p> </br> <p>Subnetting. Many hate it, but it’s the KEY to ensuring your internal network infrastructure is properly protected. Threat actors exploit stationary setups. By moving systems around on your network, and applying complex tactics, on top of implementing advanced security systems, I’ll be able to neutralize any chance of threat actors finding everything easily on your network. They’ll have to work for their food, and in doing so, will trigger security systems and various means to track their intrusive behavior. </p> </br></br> <p>🎃 Defense measures agaisnt network traffic interception</p> </br> <p>It’s most certainly possible to prevent threat actors from performing recon on your network infrastructure. Whether you want to is up to you! By combining what I’ve been explaining so far about network security, we can foster not only an environment that’s foreign to threat actors, but one where they can’t attempt to try and locate anything on top of subnetting measures that might be applied over the course of this service. </p> </br></br> <p>🎃 Potential open services that might exist </p> </br> <p>Identifying services on your network that are open on stuff like printers for example, helps prevent potential botnets, more so when it could potentially come from services you might heavily rely on for your business infrastructure such as file transfers and printing for example.</p> </br> <p>And a lot more! There’s endless testing that can be done here!</p> </br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; font-size: 30px;">🎃 What You’ll Do? 🎃</h4></br> <p>🎃 Forward me the overall scope for the Pentest and what I need to test for.
