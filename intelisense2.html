Have them show me around the code base and anything I’ll be working on. I’ll be working alongside them in order to ensure that any and all possible vulnerabilities are fully discovered. </p> </br> <p>🎃 Give me access to what I need and ONLY what I need. The point of this is to focus on what requires security to be built with in mind. </p> </br> <p>🎃 Participate in weekly briefings where I both update and check in with you to see if there is anything else I need to work on as well as give overall progress reports</p> </br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; font-size: 30px;">🎃 What I'll Do? 🎃</h4></br> <p>🎃 Generate weekly reports based on my findings that are easily digestiible by those that aren’t tech/security savvy. My goal is to emphasize the big risks your business infrastructure could face if such flaws are left unattended. You’ll not only get a unique version of each report that’s engaging, but you’ll also receive diagrams that further break down my findings to you.</p> </br> <p>🎃 Run security tests where permissible in disclosed enviornments. You call the shots on where I’m allowed to test. Not only will I be inspecting your code, but I’ll be crafting exploits to test it. If you would like exploit demonstrations, feel free add that in as a part of your consulting fees.</p> </br> <p>🎃 Each time a vulnerability is discovered, you’ll get full explanations as well as the best means to mitigate it. Your dev team will take it from there and patch it. If you would like me to be a part of the process and add in mitigations I’ve worked on, feel free to add that in as a part of your consultation fees. </p>

I’ll be crafting full blown exploits to the highest extent as if I were a threat actor, incorporating both means of white box testing and black box testing.</p> </br> <p>🎃 You’ll be participating in meetings that will require at least one technical person in charge of overall development for a particular project you’re working on. I’ll be breaking down not only the potential risks, but I’ll also be demonstrating various case scenarios that can occur if you leave a potential risk exposed. I’ll also be tallying up the fines that could result from accepting the risk and the potential damage it could do to your business infrastructure. I want you to NEVER ignore the risk!</p> </br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; font-size: 30px;">🎃 What I'll Do? 🎃</h4></br> <p>🎃 On top vulnerability assessment diagrams, I’ll be designing attack tree diagrams that will show you all potential attack vectors that exist in your infrastructure. </p> </br> <p>🎃 I’ll be engaging in custom exploitation development that can be modeled to real world levels outside simulations. You’ll get a simulation of course, but it’ll be based on REAL possible scenarios that could occur. You need to be prepared in the event a threat actor does show up. </p> </br> <p>🎃 I’ll be paring in daily briefings with your head dev so I can instruct them on what needs to be done. </p>

Compared to the last two consultations, where I’m mostly pointing things out and mapping out scenarios, I’ll be fully in charge, working alongside your head devs to implement the fixes. </p> </br> <p>🎃 You’ll instruct your head devs to allow me to work as I need to. The goal is to patch your systems, NOT clash with your developers. I need my space and means to work, so please allow me to do so. </p> </br> <p>🎃 You’ll implement the actual fixes. Don’t waste either of our time or your money if you don’t plan to see it through. </p> </br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; font-size: 30px;">🎃 What I'll Do? 🎃</h4></br> <p>🎃 I’ll be taking more charge during the mitigation process, working alongside devs to directly patch any and all vulnerabilities in your systems</p> </br> <p>🎃 Meetings will take place that will incorporate both the vulnerability diagrams, exploit attack tree scenarios, as well as a fully fledged mitigation plan and strategy that breaks everything down for those that are both technical and non technical. </p> </br>

I need this information in order to conduct research in order to find the best approach of removing the malware for you</p> </br> <p>🎃 Disclose how I’ll be interacting with the system. Is it an onsite pickup? Remote? I need to know so I can properly engage. I recommend options like onsite visits as well as simply directly sending me the infected system so I can further inspect it.</p> </br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; font-size: 30px;">🎃 What I'll Do? 🎃</h4></br> <p>🎃 Once You’ve disclosed the symptoms to me, as part of the first initial process of consultation, I’ll break down the root cause of analysis and any potential fixes that can be done for you. From there you decide if you wish to either remediate the system(s) yourself, OR, you can have me do it!</p> </br> <p>🎃 I’ll plan out a route of engagement and timeframe on how long it’ll take to deal with the system(s)</p> </br> <p>🎃 Once the malware is removed, you’ll be given further instructions on how to prevent future infections</p>

If you happen to find source code of any kind, feel free to send it over, and I’ll take a look at it. </p> </br> <p>🎃 I’ll document a full report that breaks down how the malware works and measures that can be taken to mitigate it should the need to arise</p>

This’ll tell me what I’m up against and what to strategize for. </p> </br> <p>🎃 Tell me the systems I’m allowed to test against. If you can, create a separate environment where I can do just that on. This allows me to work optimally and safely since I plan to go all out as if it were a REAL attack! </p> </br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; font-size: 30px;">🎃 What I'll Do? 🎃</h4></br> <p>🎃 Once the type of system I’m testing against is disclosed, I’ll begin researching hardware and software versions in order to gain insights on the target. Doing so allows me to better craft a malware exploit that can properly test against your systems.</p> </br> <p>🎃 Once I’ve been disclosed systems I’m allowed to test against, I’ll begin the engagement. You’ll receive write-up reports on every step of the process.</p>

If you happen to be in further need of my services, we’ll take it a step forward from there.</p> </br> <p>🎃 Disclose what you’d like me to demonstrate as well as demonstrate with. If not selected, then I’ll do the selecting myself.</p> </br> <p>🎃 Disclose the number of people attending the workshop. I charge per person per entree on top of the base consulting fee.</p> </br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; font-size: 30px;">🎃 What I'll Do? 🎃</h4></br> <p>🎃 I’ll plan out our meeting, taking any details given to me in advance so I can further assist you. I recommend having what you want to talk about disclosed before hand via email so I can easily assist you and answer any questions on the fly. It also sets a nice pace for the meeting. </p> </br> <p>🎃 Once we’ve settled on what you’d like me to demonstrate for the workshop, OR, should I be the one selecting what’ll be demonstrated, I’ll begin prepping for the workshop.</p> </br> <p>🎃 After getting a headcount for the people attending, I’ll plan out how to setup for the event as well as visuals and audio so all goes well. You’ll be the one providing the equipment and setup. I’ll be arriving a week in advance to prep for the setup and everything.</p>
