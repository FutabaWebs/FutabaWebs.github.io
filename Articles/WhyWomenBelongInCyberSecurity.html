This is a month where we celebrate the rich history of women and the major overall role of women in tech, in my case the big contributions for tech that they have made over the years that they haven’t received the credit that has been long overdue. Without women in tech Cyber Security and all forms of modern technology, as well as programming languages and methodologies wouldn’t exist without them.

                        <h4 id = "origin">Women were the first programmers and invented the first computing system 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

                        <img src="Images/ada.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img">
                    </br>
                </br>

						<p>The first programmer, and the first to develop the first computing system EVER, was by a woman named “Ada Lovelace'' who invented the “analytical” engine that theorized the main concept of numbers, “ones and zeroes” could be used for computing technology purposes other than just a mere “calculator”. Revolutionary, as it plays a vital role in how a computing system works on a binary level, using either a compiler or interpreter on behalf of a human readable programming language, to convert human readable instructions into code that a machine can understand. </p>

                      
                        <h4 id = "cobol">COBOL, the first HUMAN programming language, was invented by a WOMAN 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>
                        
                        <img src="Images/grace.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img">
                    </br>
                </br>
                        
						<p>Yes, you heard that right ladies and gentlemen, the first modern human readable programming language that involved converting human words into machine code was made by a woman, specifically, “Grace Hopper”. She personally taught MEN and WOMEN how to use the language, which revolutionized the accessibility of programming. No more punch card systems. Without her we wouldn’t even have modern programming syntax that is mostly based on C.</p>

                        <p></p>

                    <h4 id = "fulltime">The first full time paid programmers were Women 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

                        <img src="Images/fulltime.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img">
                    </br>
                </br>

						<p>Women were the first full time paid computer programmers, and were in charge of the ENIAC systems that relied on the punch card system. These systems were also responsible for bringing us to space via NASA’s Apollo Project in 1969.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>The sad tale to this is women were considered to be just “refrigerator ladies” even though they played a major role in the advancement of computer technology which brought us to space. </p>

                        <p>Yup, you heard that right! WOMEN TOOK US TO SPACE!  A woman named “Margaret Hamilton” invented the “Apollo Code” in 1969, which took us to space for the very first time!  I LOVE THIS WOMAN SO MUCH I JUST WANT TO SHAKE HER HAND AND GET HER AUTOGRAPH. You think she’d sign my laptop? NO…. MY CODE… SIGN MY CODE!!!! SIGN IT (remembers that  this is an article and I’ve started  nerding out).</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I look up to this woman all the time and bring her up when I meet women that feel less encouraged to pursue technology.</p>

                </br>

                        <p>A woman named “Hedy Lamarr”, was the sole inventor and pioneer of wireless technologies: WiFi, Bluetooth, as well as modern GPS systems and the security implementation behind them. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>This also influences any and all modern technical standards like IEEE which ensure the overall standard and security set in place for modern day wireless technologies. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Without her we wouldn’t have cool wireless cards that hackers use to crack and pen-test against wireless standards and test their security.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>We would also not have any form of satellite systems, microwave communication pipelines, GMS systems for cellular communication, etc, if she had not pioneered wireless technologies that are heavily implemented today. She plays one of the biggest roles in tech alongside “Margaret Hamilton” and “Ada Lovelace”.</p>
