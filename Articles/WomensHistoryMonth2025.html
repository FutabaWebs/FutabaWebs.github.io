						<p>Specializing in Threat Hunting, she’s an SOC operations analyst at the one, the only, Wiz, a company specializing in cloud based security, threat hunting, and overall Security research, most of which is publicly available on their white paper resource page. 
						</p>
						</br>

                        <p>If you’re looking to stay up to date with some of their latest research, she’s the best person to go to for that! She plucks the most interesting stuff and talks about it in her videos. 

 
						</p>
						</br>

                        <p>Another thing to note about her content is it’s rather unique, both in terms of the theme and the overall vibe you get from it. Think of it like a pink/purple chill Ghibli vibe if any that makes sense. 

 
						</p>
						</br>

                        <p>She also hands down has some of the best written documentation I’ve ever seen since she spices it up a bit using canva in order to design fun themes for them, enticing you, making you WANT to read it vs a simple document with no character to it.

                        <p>Fun fact, a lot of my content ideas have actually stemmed from her LinkedIn content, such as one of my past articles focusing on the Confluence ransomware data breach as well as Claude AI which I talked about a while back.

						<p>Specializing in CTI, Cyber Threat Intelligence, as well as Blue Team Operations, she uses threat intelligence in order to better secure our digital landscape! 
						</p>
						</br>

                        <p>If you don’t know what threat intelligence is, as the name suggests, it’s the essential gathering of information, in this case, for various Cyber Security threats that could pose risk for various infrastructures. 

 
						</p>
						</br>

                        <p>Using this information, Jennifer is able to run security assessments and test for some of the most critical ones or latest ones against any business model she secures, checking if it exists, mitigating it should it exist!

                        <p>She’s also known as “Alt-Funktion”, and runs her own YouTube channel and content that breaks down a lot of CTI and other Cyber Security subject matter in a meaningful and engaging way, easy for folks to understand.

						</p>
						</br>

                        <p>She also has a unique theme and vibe as well. In case you haven’t realized this yet, folks that have uniqueness and character stand out to me. She also respects the color purple like most of the women on this list so that’s brownie points for me as well!

						</br>

                        <p>She’s also the co-founder of “Future Proof Security”, a company run by her and Bailey Marshel. It focuses on online Child safety and awareness practices.

                        <p>I’m not sure if she considers herself this, but she’s basically one of those “geniuses” whose talent deserves a little more love and shine! She’s only 18, and has made a lot of major accomplishments within her technical career prior to that age, most of which some folks never achieve until their late 20’s.

                        <p>Her potential is fascinating, to the point even I can say I could learn a lot from her. She’s smart and ingenious. Her ideas are refreshing! Check her out!

						</p>
						</br>

                        <p>She’s also the co-founder of a company known as “Xintra”, a training simulator platform unlike any other. Rather than basic boring simulations that aren’t applicable on a real world level, she kicks it up a notch, basing them around the various Cyber threats around the world she covers in her research. Yes, YOU, get to TRY what they did in a simulated environment in order to learn stuff you wouldn’t find in any FREE resources, even most paid ones today.

						<p>Seeing as these two specialize and sort of do the same thing, I figured to talk about BOTH of them in one go for this section. 
						</p>
						</br>

                        <p>Their bread and butter is OSINT, Open Source Intelligence gathering! Think of OSINT as the parent of various forms of threat hunting and intelligence research, focusing on various ways to retrieve intelligence about anything you’re looking for online, including the usage of tools to do so. 

 
						</p>
						</br>

                        <p>🎃 Nina runs a blog here on her medium, centered around her “late night”, findings series, where she uncovers a lot of what goes on in the digital world: deep web, platforms like Telegram, all sorts of stuff! If you’re looking to truly journey into the world of the web and see what goes on, check out her stuff! 
						</p>
						</br>

                        <p>🎃 Mrs. OSINT , personally, is where you should start if you’re NEW to OSINT, as she centers a lot of her content for beginners, teaching you tools and techniques you can use in order to dive into the world of OSINT. I recommend diving into her stuff first, pivoting into Nina’s content as that caters more to folks that already know a thing or two about OSINT!

                <p>If you LOVE what my Discord server has been doing lately, then you’ll LOVE what she does! It’s that but on STEROIDS, and although the community is heavily Chinese focused at the moment (She’s working on the English community and a lot more), the resources she has are PHENOMENAL and I can’t bear to look away! Most Discord servers or Telegram groups I usually mute them the moment I get in it because it’s just nonsense, but not in this case! Even her social updates are just PRACTICAL and I WANT to see them!
