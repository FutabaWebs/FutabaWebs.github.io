						<p> The Danger! Series is I raise more awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!
						</p>

<p>  It's no shocker that programming is one of the most core skill sets a hacker can wield. Nearly EVERY tool or form of security software we have set in place has code behind it. Even injection techniques require you to know how to code, more so once you dive into things on a granular level!

    <p> This series is focuses on teaching you how to highlight vulnerabilities that exist in code bases for various software products.

    </br>
    
    <p> Much like the new malware lab series I'll be introducing, this series will do the exact same thing, EXCEPT, for defensive purposes.

    </br>
    
    <p>My goal for this is to also have stuff like watch parties you can join in and ask me questions about in case there's anything you don't understand!

<p> I've talked about this before, but nearly all of my series, at some point, will have a lab excersize that's FULLY hands on, rather, it's a lab that you do along side a video in order to build REAL skills from all the stuff you're learning from my content over each set of parts they have.

<p>Any and all past articles I've done will be featuring voice overs, including all of my past exploit guides!

<p>All of this Sounds fun!?

<p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!
