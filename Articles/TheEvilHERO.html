								<p>Today’s article is going to be a more Darker toned one where I elaborate on why I became a professional Hacker, diving more into the deep complexities and mysteries behind my overall skills sets as well as one of the true hidden purposes behind my brand and what it is I aim to achieve with it on top of the many things it does/plans to do already. This article is going to be a bit on the 5 to 6 min read side so do be warned!


								</br> 
								</br>
								I’m also going to further elaborate on WHY I identify as a “Gray Hat” Hacker, something I’ve mentioned before but never really dived into much which plays a HUGE role in explaining the overall premise of this article. I’ll brush up on what a Gray Hat Hacker is so that anyone reading this can follow along smoothly, as well as leaving a link to the various Hat Archetypes that define each hacker and their overall purpose. 


							</br> 
								</br>
									
                                Most people when they’re looking to get into Hacking/Cyber Security their overall purpose is to either do it for fun or to pursue it as a professional career. Usually it’s a mixture of the two which is also part of the main reason I do it. HOWEVER, like I’ve stated in the main premise, there’s another hidden reason I do this, and why my skill sets are so broad for what they are. 

								</p>

									I want you to pay CLOSE attention to the title of this article, as it’s symbolic and serves a purpose.

							</br> 
								</br>

									Fair warning before I begin, this article will contain SENSITIVE topics that might be faint for the heart, so feel free to click off this if this ain’t your cup of tea. I want to experiment with writing articles that address real world matters and how Hacking/Cyber Security applies to it, rather, what we can do as Hackers/Cyber Security professionals to address it.

						<h4 id = "grayhat">What is a Gray Hat Hacker? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸


                        </h4>

						<p>Gray Hat Hackers are a mixture of quality traits between White Hat Hackers, whom are good guys, and Black Hat Hackers, whom are bad guys, incorporating a series of ethical and unethical means in order to achieve their objective which tends to be more along the lines of “Hacktivism” for a greater cause or purpose. To put it into better perspective, they are GOOD guys that aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty, hence being in the gray area swaying either way. Their skill sets also tend to be a bit broad while having a certain niche.</p>

						<p></p>

						<p>A PERFECT example of one would be the infamous “Anonymous” group, where they target a lot of terrorist groups and corrupt organizations and expose them for the betterment of the world! They do whatever it takes to get the job done incorporating a wide variety of techniques, which allows them to achieve feats the ordinary Hacker/Cyber Security professional might have never thought were possible. </p>

						<p></p>

						<p>Be mindful, although Gray Hats aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty and will do ANYTHING to get the job done, they don’t usually resort to killing, as they tend to be more on the pacifist side, not ALL, but most in general. </p>

						<p></p>

						<p>You can find out more about the various "Hats" in this article I wrote <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hacking-persona-roy-bull-futaba-webs--odlte/?trackingId=o6RzyGWVTmiE58TTov8Uxw%3D%3D&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BiEPZP9IMRwqxRtJcYxkEuA%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>.</p>


					
					<h4 id = "hunter">Hunter Hunter 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                    </h4>

					<p>I’ve talked about this before in my <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/one-above-all-roy-bull-futaba-webs--vx5pf?trackingId=9dNVZnh5SdiyRk4Q8CTd6A%3D%3D&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BcJcZClhBTHmX4JUP4%2FYt0g%3D%3D&" style = "text-decoration: none;">“The One Above All”</a> article, but one of the main reasons why hackers do what they do is because THEY LOVE the THRILL of the hunt. What it is they like to hunt depends on the hacker which will greatly influence the skill sets they possess.</p>

					<p></p>

					<p>For example, CTF players that hack on a comptetional level, love the overall thrill of finding the exploit to secure the flag which tests the full limits of their capabilities. It’s exhilarating knowing you’ve pwned a system and have TOTAL control over it, as well as the many secrets it possesses. It’s even more exhilarating if you apply it on an unethical level and dabble in what you shouldn’t (I’m NOT encouraging you to do this!)</p>

					<p></p>

					<p>In this case, since we’re talking about Gray Hats, the thrill of the hunt for us is hunting whatever it is we’re most passionate about when it comes to activism.</p>


<h4 id = "reason">Why I Became A Hacker? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸
</h4>

<p>The main reason I became a Hacker as well as a Cyber Security professional is to assist organizations that help track down and stop human trafficking operations, as well as anything along the lines of CSAM content distribution and a lot more. In other words….. I HUNT PREDATORS AND AM OBSESSED WITH DOING SO! If you would like to find out more about what CSAM is and why I fight against it, you can find out more about that in this article <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/danger-e2e-encourages-csam-roy-bull-futaba-webs--wzy1e/?trackingId=9Z9WiLZBQ72iFiTQFqI4Zg%3D%3D&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BiEPZP9IMRwqxRtJcYxkEuA%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>. I wrote it a while back to help raise awareness for how end to end encryption assists Child Predators online.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Although there are MANY things I would do to a predator if one were presented in front of me… I need a way to get my hands dirty while keeping it ethical! By working with organizations, even ghost ones for example that assist law enforcement, I can do just that, creating a world safer for women and children, most of which are the main target for these forms of operations.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There are also many other areas of activism I fancy such as hunt</p>

<p></p>

<p>🎃 Hunting scammers (I’m looking at you JOB SCAMMERS)</p>

<p>🎃 Hunting domestic violence perpetrators</p>

<p></p>

<p>and a lot more. </p>

<p></p>

			<h4 id = "hunt">What Inspired me to Hunt Predators? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸
            </h4>

			<p>I’ve talked about this before, but my best friend was almost a victim of sexual assault and a lot more, where her step father abused her and put her in situations no little girl should have to go through, her mother being one of the many bystanders that allowed this to happen. There’s an inspirational video <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7222443269262053376-a5-r?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BiEPZP9IMRwqxRtJcYxkEuA%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a> you should check out if you wanna hear my view points on why we need to teach children how to protect themselves online.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>A lot of Child predators exist among us, most of which go unnoticed since their targets are usually those that are unable to defend themselves and or unable to tell when they’re being taken advantage of. There are also groups of people, usually on the dark net, that create content and distribute it amongst themselves as some sort of fetish party, often getting away with it due to various protocols such as the TOR onion one that assist in protecting their anonymity online. </p>

			<p></p>

			<p>By hunting predators and exposing their identities as well as how they are able to do what they do, I aim to help clean up the internet and help make it a safer place for Children online. All of this, of course, could also apply to what I’ve stated before about help fighting human traffic operations.</p>

			
			<h4 id = "evilhero">The Evil HERO 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸
			</h4>
			
			<p>The Evil HERO is a side brand that I’ll be launching in the near future that focuses on partnering with organizations that help combat the things I’ve talked about in this article. It is symbolic for a HERO, or rather, an Anti-HERO that is willing to do whatever it takes in order to fight predatory activities. </p>

			<p></p>

			<p>I’ll be having side content that will strictly be there, focusing on news and updates regarding various predatory activities and what we can do to stop them. </p>

		</br>
			
				

<p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!
