                        </h4>

						<p>I’m also going to dive into a sensitive topic as to why it’s hard to find a mentor, as well as the general etiquette and relationship dynamic between mentor and mentee. This is to help show you the do’s and don’ts when looking for one, as well as how to maintain one should you happen to find one. Mentors, GOOD ones, are HARD to find, so if you happen to land one, MAINTAIN IT! </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I’m also going to address the BIG dangers of free learning and why it doesn't work for everyone. This will better establish the main reason why people still seek mentorship even though they can learn for FREE at NO COST on their own.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>This article is made specially after the announcement of a hybrid mentorship program that I’m working on that will be available soon! You can check out the details on my linktree <a href = "https://linktr.ee/Futaba_Webs" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a> if you would like! MORE COMING SOON FOR IT! </p>

                    <h4 id = "mentor">The role of a Cyber Security Mentors 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>Cyber Security mentors are the people with experience that lead and guide the next wave of people that are seeking to enter the field. They are your teachers, and like all teachers, are CRUCIAL in order to build up your repertoire of knowledge needed to succeed in your field. They help guide you through all the stuff you need to know and filter out the stuff you don’t need to know. They also help you figure out your main interest, and narrow the skill sets you need to learn in order to succeed. They also help you develop the proper critical thinking skills that are needed to succeed in your field as well. </p>

                    
        <h4 id = "part1">Why is finding a mentor so hard? (Part 1) 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>One of the biggest reasons why it’s hard to find a mentor is due to the shady intentions that come from most people in the Cyber Security field. It’s not news by now that a lot of people in Cyber are just looking to sell you false hopes and dreams, empty promises that are just a mere cash grab. LEARN CYBER SECURITY IN 24 WEEKS AND MASTER— You pick up what I’m putting down right?</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Not everyone has the best intentions for you, and some, quite frankly… even those that have been in the field for years with a shiny title… Don’t know their stuff and THEY are the ones that are holding the high level certs and positions.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>You need to also be mindful, THERE IS A LOT OF GATEKEEPING in this field. People are willing to lead others down the wrong path if it means they keep you out and or get in. If you’re looking for a mentor, make sure you check their credibility and look into them before you check in for services with them. I recommend looking for mentors that are SHOWING you what they know vs ones that HIDE all of their stuff. YouTube content creators like Rana Khali, who now runs her own academy is a classic example of someone that has established solid credibility and trust that you can look into if you need mentorship. </p>

                        <h4 id = "part2">Why is finding a mentor so hard? (Part 2) 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>Much like how not all mentors have the best of intentions, the same can also be said for mentees. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Mentees, for those that do not know, have been known to take advantage of their mentors, especially the free ones who are commonly sought after. A lot of this is due to a sense of entitlement and them using any means to get in, even if they have to exploit their fellow learners and mentors in the process. Not everyone is looking to win with you so you need to be mindful of that!</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>A lot of people, and I’m sorry to even have to say this, belittle mentors, specifically ones that help for free. Some even ghost their mentors after they help them land a job. It’s these very critical reasons why free mentors are stepping away, most charging you now for their time. People don't want to be taken advantage of. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>This also explains the main reason why people aren’t very “friendly” when you DM them and ask them for tips and tricks, and why if you do get a “free” answer, it's rather vague.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>For me personally, it is the main reason why I have rejected EVERY SINGLE person that has asked for free mentorship thus far. All it takes is for ONE bad cookie, and it has a rippling effect. </p>

                        </h4>

						<p>Most people sadly aren’t mentorable. More times than none, as someone that mentors consistently, PEOPLE DO NOT LISTEN TO THEIR MENTORS! If you are going to seek mentorship LISTEN TO THE PROFESSIONALS advice, especially if it comes from one that is highly credible.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>People are looking for shortcuts to get in, and when they find out there aren’t any, and they have to do and learn the thing, they bail out and stop listening to their mentor, thinking they are trying to mislead them. THEY AREN’T, AND YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO THEM, otherwise you are just setting yourself back, and wasting everyone’s valuable time!</p>

                <h4 id = "notrecruiters">MENTORS ARE NOT RECRUITERS! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>Mentors are NOT recruiters. It’s not their job to land you a role, that’s YOUR job, as well as the job of a recruiter. </p>

                        <p></p>


                        <p>People often leave their mentorships due to not securing a role, because they have the impression that their mentor is responsible for that. They don’t owe you that nor should you expect that from them, especially if they are trying to help you for free. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>They are there to guide/teach you how Cyber Security works so that you build up the skill sets needed to succeed in this field. It’s YOUR job to decide what you do with that knowledge. No one is responsible for your success but you!</p>

                        <h4 id = "communication">Communication is KEY! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>Keep in touch with your mentor! It’s CRUCIAL! As I’ve mentioned before, there is a lot of ghosting going around lately towards mentors that put in a lot of time to help their mentees, especially ones that do so for FREE. Respect their time and keep in touch!</p>


                 
                       

                <h4 id = "personal">Keep your personal feelings outside of your mentorship 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>I cannot stress this enough, and this also applies to the real world in general, NO ONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR PERSONAL PROBLEMS. Don’t take your personal issues out on your mentor. They are here to help you! It’s your job to stay in touch and give that bit of communication in case something does happen so they can understand. People can’t understand you if you don’t communicate! </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>RESPECT YOUR MENTORS!</p>

                <h4 id = "free">Do you want FREE learning or FREE Mentorship? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>A lot of people think that the thing they want is FREE learning, but it’s not, it’s free mentorship and guidance which no one owes you! </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Teaching yourself anything from the ground up is possible, but it’s EXTREMELY HARD! There is no one to guide you or explain the stuff you need to know. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I’ve been self taught for about 11 years now and I reassure you, figuring out where I had to go for Cyber was hard. I was running around in circles trying to figure stuff out. I wasn’t able to find a Cyber mentor due to all the things that I’ve mentioned, which is why I put so much effort into it. PEOPLE NEED MENTORS!</p>
