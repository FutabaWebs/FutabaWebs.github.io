						<h2 id = "Article"> 🎃 The Goal Of Futaba_Webs </h2>
						<h4 id = "whitepaper">White Paper Research 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

						</h4>

						<p>One of the main aspects of my brand is the white paper research I develop, where I create article and video based material that focus on offensive security and many other skill traits I happen to possess that can be applied to “PRACTICAL” hacking on a fundamental level. It’s basically research material that can be more realistically applied to the real world vs most ethical material that tends to be on the simulated side of things. You could also say in a sense I’m taking simulated material and creating REAL world applications for it. </p>
                        
                        <p></p>
                        
                        <p>I’m also designing a mentorship program that will help speed up the process on what people do and don’t need to know in order to get into Cyber Security, as well as get them ready for several certs all in one goal. This is long in development and won’t be available until another 4 or 5 years or so. It could be sooner depending on how things go. </p>
                    
                        <p></p>
                        
                        <p>The goal of all of this is not to only be a form of revenue I can make by teaching and training up and coming Cyber Security professionals, but as a means to serve as a large scale portfolio that shows what I’m fully capable of. </p>
                        
                        <p></p>
                    
                        <p>There’s also a sub category branch in here that’s going to feature some stuff that will focus on helping more women get into Cyber and tech overall as they’re mega underrepresented. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>You can find out more about this in my <a href = "https://www.patreon.com/Futaba_Webs" style = "text-decoration: none;">Patreon</a>. Reviews of my mentoring sessions can be found in my <a href = "https://linktr.ee/Futaba_Webs" style = "text-decoration: none;">LinkTree</a>.</p>
					
					
					<h4 id = "tooldev">Tool Development 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸                   </h4>

					<p>One of the things I’ll be focusing on in the long run will be tool development, ranging from a variety of custom software tools to aid penetration testers for exploitation development, as well as physical tools that can aid physical penetration testers.</p>

                    <p></p>

                    <p>You can find out more about that on my YouPic page <a href = "https://youpic.com/futaba_webs" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>.</p>

                    <p></p>

                    <p>In terms of the physical side of things, think of me as the more “gamified” version of what hack5 does. I’m modeling tools that are themed from some of my favorite video game series of all time while still being realistic enough to be applicable to the real world. </p>

                    <p></p>

                    <p>For example, one of my main ongoing projects is a custom penetration testing drone I’m working on that’s inspired from Watch Dogs 2.</p>

                    <p></p>

                    <p>Check out this <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7168286134790254592/?originTrackingId=K02WBbZnSbyU%2FjM%2FdEki%2Bw%3D%3D&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BdWln0ihXRf6spugiMPdjlw%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;">video</a> I made a while back of a custom rubber ducky I made that acts as a LAN turtle, writing its own code and pwning a system via a custom Python script. </p>

                <h4 id = "contractor">Independent Contractor 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                </h4>
    
                <p>I haven’t spoken on this much until now, but one of the main end goals for me in the long run so I’m never in a situation where I’m out of work, is I want to become an independent contractor that provides penetration testing services and a variety of other things to people. You can find out more about the services I plan to provide on this page <a href = "https://cypsec.xyz/offering/futaba" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a> for the company I’m currently partnered with to provide services through my brand. </p>
                
                <p></p>
                
                <p>It’s no shocker, but in today’s tech market ESPECIALLY for Cyber Security, you mustn't rely on an employer to give you a chance or keep you in Cyber. You need to do that yourself. </p>
                
                <p></p>
                
                <p>By having my own flow of contractor work, not only do I stay in the game and gain more experience, but I put myself in a situation where it presents more full time opportunities for me by networking me via contracts, BUT, I also am in a situation where I don’t have to rely on an employer to keep money in pocket. It’s a win win situation IF I play my cards right which I’ve been doing so far. It’s all a matter of perseverance and being patient.</p>
                
                <p></p>
                
                <p>I’m starting an official LLC soon so I’ll be able to provide said services on the book to people, as well as the many other services that have been talked about so far in my article. </p>
