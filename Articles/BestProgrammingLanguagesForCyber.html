                                I’ve talked about this before, but THERE ARE A LOT of jobs in Cyber that will HIRE you if you know how to code: Security Engineering, Web Application Security, and of course, Malware analysis and Reverse engineering which a lot of people seem to really be into.

                                The overall goal of this article is to inspire you to pick up a programming language for the first time and learn to code. Programming isn’t as scary as people make it out to be. 


                                </br> 
								</br>

                                To encourage you more, I’ll even address a sensitive topic on whether or not you need to be GOOD at MATH in order to code, a topic which most people that DON’T know how to code speak on a lot. 



                                </br> 
								</br>

                                Be mindful, in terms of programming in general, THERE is no predefined order on which you learn first. It depends on the path you choose for what you intend to do. In my case I am speaking on HACKING/CYBER, NOT Software Engineering altogether!

						<h2 id = "Article"> 🎃 BEST Programming Languages For Cyber?  </h2>
						<h4 id = "python">Learn Python FIRST 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸
                        </h4>

						<p>It’s a no brainer…. but LEARN PYTHON FIRST! It’s a beginner friendly programming language that’s easy to learn and pick up, AND, you can do A LOT of crazy stuff with it! </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>You’ve seen my exploits and tools right? Nearly ALL of them are written in Python!</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>A LOT of people sh*t on python, but you know what they say, "ThEy HaTe Me CaUsE tHeY aIn'T mE 🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴"</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Python is a multi-tool language that can do a variety of things: electrical engineering, GUI development, web development, machine learning, even low level stuff which it’s not designed to do. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>It receives a TON of support, so much that you often question “what can’t python do?” It doesn't outdo EVERY programming language, BUT, it does do a bit of everything which is what makes it a hackers best friend. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Python is also a language that writes LESS and does MORE, which is one of the MAIN reasons it’s a hackers BEST FRIEND! A lot of my tools that I wrote would simply take TOO long to write in another language, whereas with Python, because it has such efficient and well written modules and frameworks for it, I can do something as simple as creating a backdoor in less than 20 lines of code. </p>

					
					<h4 id = "cpp">Learn C++ 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸
                    </h4>

					<p>I know MANY will disagree with me on this, but pick up C++. It REWARDS you MEGA hard in the long run, allowing you to pick up MANY programming languages and native fundamentals, as well as the native language it stems from which all syntax is based on which is C. You’ll be a coding monster in no time and will be able to speed blitz learning languages left and right!</p>

                    <p></p>

                    <p>“But Futaba C++ IS TOO HARD!” </p>

                    <p></p>

                    <p>NO, it’s not! MANY are just BAD teachers! You’d be surprised how simple the language is to learn if people just EXPLAINED it to you properly!</p>

                    <p></p>

                    <p>C++ gets a bad rep for being a HARD language due to OOP(Object Oriented Programming), which honestly isn’t hard either. </p>

                    <p></p>

                    <p>C++ allows you to do a lot of low level stuff, on top of allowing you to dive more into malware analysis and reverse engineering. You can also do robotics with it!</p>

                    <p></p>

                    <p>If you manage to get past the learning curve you’ll be unstoppable in the long run. </p>

            <p>NO! YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNOW HIGH LEVEL MATH IN ORDER TO CODE!!</p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Schools that lie to students dropping their drinks after me saying all of this</p>

            <p></p>

            <p>YES ladies and gentlemen, people are LYING to you when they say you NEED to know advanced mathematics! I’ve been programming for over 12 years and not once have I ever needed advanced: algebra, geometry, calculus, etc in order to code. All you need to do is understand how programming works as a science and how to apply it in the real world. All the math is done for you. The most you’ll need is BASIC arithmetic!</p>

            <p></p>

            <p>There’s a reason why we have stuff like frameworks and SDKs(Software Developer Kits). It’s to make it easier for people to code, preventing you from having to build all of that stuff all over again. </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The only time you’ll need high level mathematics is if you’re building your own encryption cipher from scratch, OR, if you happen to be doing anything that REQUIRES Math!</p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Colleges and Universities: “BUT THE CURRICULUM!!!!</p>

            <p></p>

            <p>SCREW THE CURRICULUM! I AM THE CURRICULUM! </p>

<p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!
