                </br>

                <p>My first Cyber Security Job was at WePlayed Sports, an internship from my mentor, focusing on Cyber Analyst responsibilities, Penetration Testing and Offensive Security, as well as overall Security Research responsibilities. He took a chance on me and truly allowed me to finally gain REAL hands on experience that allowed me to apply what I’ve learned!

            </p>
        </br>

        <p>I primarily stay up to date with the latest Cyber Security trends and threats via my Discord server community. It serves as a collective for various research and news material I can sort through and a lot more. It also serves to aid me with generating content creation ideas for my white paper research.

                    </strong>
					</p>
				</br>

					<p> Pick an area in tech that you like and apply Security to it! Cyber Security is EVERYWHERE!!🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸:

					</p>
				
					
					<p> 🎃 I.T. Help Desk 

					</p>
				


					<p> 🎃 Software Engineering 

					</p>
			

				<p>🎃 System admin 

				</p>
			

            <p> and the list goes on! All you need to do is simply convert your skills to fit the bill and you're good to go!
 

            </p>
        </br>
        
        <p> The problem with pursuing a career in Cyber Security is folks are being lead astray, thinking they're gonna start out in Cyber from the get go. You first need to become proficient in a skill trade in tech in order to even begin "securing it". That all make sense?

 

        </p>
    </br>

    <p> <strong> 
        <em>🎃 “What certifications or skills do you think are essential for someone entering the field today?"</em>
    </strong> 

    </p>
</br>

<p> Anything from: HTB, TCM, and Offsec are practical certs that will set you up in the long run, as well as the ISC2 CC cert which is FREE and desired for entry level folks looking to break into Cyber Security!
 

</p>
</br>

<p> If you’re going for anything from Comptia, then I recommend the following: Sec+, CySa+, PenTest+, Linux+, and of course, the classic A+ certification which is essential if you’re starting out in I.T.

</p>
</br>

<p> <strong> 
    <em>🎃 “Can you share a story about a particularly memorable cybersecurity incident you have handled? What was the outcome?"</em>
</strong>  

</p>
</br>

<p> A recent incident I can share came from one of my previous I.T. Help Desk roles at TBG, “The Bachrach Group”. 

</p>
</br>

<p> During one of my early morning floor sweeps, I ran into a system that was stuck in the bios as if someone were trying to pop the system physically. This might sound far fetched, but NONE of the I.T. folks (as sad as it is to say this) knew what they were doing, and for sure the folks that worked there, 99 percent of which were recruiters, didn’t know a thing about how to pop the BIOS for Windows systems. A report was made and further security measures were set in place to prevent stuff like this from happening again.

            </strong>
			</p>
		</br>

			<p> AI is nothing more than a tool that will aid and augment our current abilities. It’s not capable of replacing us as sorry as this is to say.

			</p>
			</br>
			
			<p> A.I. is currently incapable of operating on its own. If it were, then there wouldn’t be an increase in folks looking to hire MANUAL penetration testers.

                <em>🎃 “How do you balance the need for security with the importance of user privacy?"

                </em>
            </strong>
			</p>
		</br>


        <p>  This is a tough question to answer. With security, comes inconvenience. 

        </p>
        </br>

        <p> Overall in order to balance it with the importance of end user privacy, you need to present the security to them without “forcing them” to apply it. 

        </p>
        </br>

        <p>However, if this is a critical infrastructure, then sadly, even if it does inconvenience the end user, such as Zero Trust infrastructures for example, then it NEEDS to be implemented no questions asked!


        </p>
        </br>

        <p> LinkedIn ensures that ANYONE and EVERYONE you're connected to can SEE what you comment and react to! This includes YOUR posts as well! You can capitalize on this on top of what I've previously mentioned in order to get some serious traction!

        </p>
        </br>

        <p> GUARANTEED security! There’s no such thing! For as long as it’s man made, even if it’s by A.I which is also man made, FLAWS in the system will ALWAYS exist.
