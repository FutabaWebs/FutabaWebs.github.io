								The problem with this, and why it went so viral, is because they claimed that the student cheated during their exam, which is why they revoked their certifications, BUT, refuse to show evidence to support their claims.

						<h2 id = "Article"> 🎃 Is TCM Security Still Credible?  </h2>
						<h4 id = "revoke">What’s been going on regarding the TCM cert revoke situation 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

						</h4>

						<p> 🎃 TCM is basically being accused of revoking someone’s certs they PAID for because they were being trolled by them in their Discord server via memes, jokes that were essentially harmless. 
						</p>
					</br>

						<p> Link to the Tweet that went viral can be found <a href = "https://x.com/Ox4d5a/status/1909270986697961675" style = "text-decoration: none;"> here</a>, which has over 337K views and 69 retweets.
						</p>
						</br>
						
						<p> Although the Tweet censors the name of the Discord member, it’s basically the student in question that Heath Adams claims cheated during their exam which he shows ZERO proof of.
						</p>
					</br>


						<p> Heath claims the student violated TCM’s policies and sought external help during their exam, but when asked to disclose this information, even a censored version of it, he chalks it up to "privacy policies" and refuses to disclose ANYTHING, and he does, it's misleading which I’ll talk about in a bit. 
						</p>
					</br>


					
					<h4 id = "stance">TCM’s Stance on the matter 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4>

					<p>This is an official <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/heathadams_today-brings-a-good-lesson-in-doing-research-activity-7315112691344232448-tyFo/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3B9L%2BCNWjjT2GCmIn0AvK8CA%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;">response</a>! from Heath Adams, founder and CEO of TCM Security.
					</p>
				</br>

					<p> In his initial response post, and I want you to be mindful of this later on in the article, HIS words exactly, was that he didn't know anything about the meme situation everyone’s been talking about. Apparently he didn't know the meme existed.

					</p>
					</br>
					
					<p> As you can tell, it sounds fishy because along with everything else that’s been going on, they’ve been refusing to disclose ANYTHING or provide SOLID proof of what’s been happening.
					</p>
				</br>


					<p> You can find out more about what I mean in this post <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7315229441503215618/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3B9L%2BCNWjjT2GCmIn0AvK8CA%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>! from one of his official staff members that also does the same thing, where he defends TCM, but doesn’t disclose anything to clear up all the confusion that’s been going on with them on their end. Repost with my overall thoughts for it can be found <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7315280689971548160-TULT?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADJjkikBjIi1f8OFBSkenk1cDkXmxRJENZM&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3B9L%2BCNWjjT2GCmIn0AvK8CA%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>!.
					</p>
				</br>

				<p> Shortly after, Heath Updates us on the situation in another post, but AGAIN, STILL didn’t answer any questions DIRECTLY with EVIDENCE regarding the matter. I want you to pay CLOSE attention to this, as it becomes a concerning trend.
				</p>
			</br>


			<h4 id = "suspicions">Suspicions About Heath and TCM 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4>

			<p>The BIGGEST suspicion about TCM right now is how they’re handling the situation, SPECIFICALLY, their unwillingness to disclose ANY information regarding the matter, more so since they’re claiming a student cheated but refuses to disclose screenshots of any kind due to “privacy policies”. 
			</p>
		</br>

			<p> The kicker, and something strange? They happily disclose a few Discord messages from a student named “Najam UI Saqib” who DID in fact cheat during his examination, which led to his certs getting revoked. HOWEVER, this was only due to his post that went viral which Heath HAD to respond to, otherwise it would just raise more suspicions that he’s hiding something. 

			</p>
			</br>
			
			<p> NOW, he DOES in fact respond with OFFICIAL Discord server screenshots of what happened and Najam cheating and him blocking TCM staff and avoiding the situation. It gets SOOO bad that Najam actually DELETES his entire post regarding the matter after it went viral.
			</p>
		</br>


			<p>I was ECSTATIC, BUT, as you can tell it felt a little “strange”. Why? Because TCM was UNWILLING many times to disclose ANYTHING, and now all of a sudden they’re dropping screenshots and spilling the beans? Something just felt off about it, and guess what… I WAS RIGHT!
			</p>
		</br>


	<p> You can find out more about that <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7315387931953618944-pYUG?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADJjkikBjIi1f8OFBSkenk1cDkXmxRJENZM&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3B9L%2BCNWjjT2GCmIn0AvK8CA%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>!

	</p>
</br>

<p> HOWEVER, Heath raised a HUGE red flag when he messaged me directly explaining it “wasn’t” the student he was talking about regarding his second follow up post. It’s strange because now apparently there were TWO students even though he never mentions that once in any of his posts. He led us under the impression that ONE student that cheated.

</p>
</br>

<p>This did lead to me having to revise my post MULTIPLE times, even a few folks commenting they were still confused regarding the situation…. And to be honest… I was confused as well. 

</p>
</br>

<p> Something funny too, whenever ANYONE questioned what happened, Heath would BAN or BLOCK them RIGHT AWAY! He even kept an eye on people he felt would talk and looked them up on LinkedIn and blocked them right away, myself included, even if we didn't mention the companies name or his name.

</p>
</br>

<p> You can find out what I mean in these two instances here!

<p> There’s more of course, BUT, you get the point.

</br>

<h4 id = "lying">Heath Lied About Not Knowing the meme in question 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸
</h4>

<p>  In Heath’s first initial post regarding the matter, and I want you to think clearly about what I said before regarding his EXACT words, he mentions VERY CLEARLY he knows NOTHING about the meme everyone was talking about. 
</p>
</br>

<p>Sadly…. That too was also a lie. I have screenshots of him admitting and acting childish about it which is in the process of being released upon further notice. 
</p>
</br>

<p> The sad part about this, is he also lies about banning Panda, which panda confirms with DIRECT evidence that it was in fact Heath that DID ban him from the Discord server.

			<h4 id = "revised">TCM Revised Their Policies 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸
			</h4>
			
			<p> Shortly after the situation, TCM revised its policies which I found a little suspicious. Why? Because if it suddenly “changes” and no one is aware, it could lead to a situation where Heath could say stuff like this (meming) calls for a cert revoke. I’m not saying he would do that, BUT, it did scratch that part of my brain. 
			</p>
			</br>
			
			<p> Nonetheless, I took a look at the core policies, which you can read here…. And…. well…. Panda didn’t violate anything nor is there a single screenshot of him cheating during the exam as Heath claims. The only person he had visible proof of doing so that he CONFIDENTLY exposes without question was the student I mentioned earlier, “Najam UI Saqib”.
			</p>
			</br>
			
						
						<h4 id = "truth">The Truth? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸
						</h4>

					<p> The REAL victim of the whole TCM situation… and I’m sorry to have to even say this… A LOT of the current evidence on deck DOES point towards their certs being revoked for speculated reasons, A LOT of which Heath admits to in his own Discord messages under his handle name.
					</p>
				</br>
				You can find out more about the what's been going on via screen pics <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18Br09Bxw2apPmY_HGypFWXIfp0-kBHz7?usp=sharing" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>!
					</p>
					</br>
					
					<p> There might be a further witness for the whole situation, BUT, I need her consent first before I feature her in the article. TRUST me on this, IF she does, and she releases further screenshots, it will be added to the massive archive of PHOTOGRAPHIC evidence I have for this article. You'll of course be kept up to date on this!
					</p>
				</br>


					<p>The student I’m talking about is named “ExecPanda”. If you go back to that twitter screenshot, you’ll see snippets of his profile pic exposed which IS an EXACT match!
					</p>
				</br>

				<p> He was kind enough to reach out to me via Discord and explain the situation to me in FULL detail with PROOF! He was honest about the whole thing, even the memeing and trolling on the server which DID call for the Discord ban. HOWEVER, this didn't justify his certifications being taken away from him, nor did it explain WHY they were taken away from him.
				</p>
			</br>

			<p>For those that might be wondering, since this has been aired out in the open, regarding the "joke/fake" cert situation with Panda, which he did admit to, this happens after his certs were revoked and removed without warning, where he was placed under investigation, also without warning. He assumes they're gone and have been revoked since he reached out to folks in the Discord server, most saying they still had theirs. This is WHY he does this. He also reaches out to staff formally and pops the question on whether or not they were revoked about an hour later after he does this, from which they CONFIRM his certs were revoked!
			</p>
		</br>


<h4 id = "reliable">Is TCM Still Reliable? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸
</h4>

<p> To be very honest.. No… not after this.
</p>
</br>

<p> This article was kind of hard to write, since I looked up to Heath Adams when I was in my earlier days as a hacker. 
</p>
</br>

<p>I spoke good faith about him MANY times, even featured him in some of my past articles for people that wanted to break into Cyber, but he dropped the ball on this one. 
</p>
</br>


<p>He had the potential to become one of the greats when it came to Cyber Security training and industry certs. Now I have to take back what I said and revise a lot of that stuff. 
</p>
</br>

<h4 id = "AfterThoughts">After Thoughts 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

<p> This is going to be a bone chilling point I'm going to make. 

</p>
</br>

<p> Heath and everyone at TCM lectures us and says we should do our "research" yet prevents us from doing so. 

</p>
</br>

<p> The funny thing about what they're doing is when you prevent folks from researching it only leads to more speculation which can get out of hand.

</p>
</br>

<p> It's even more sketchy since he openly discloses Najam but hides everything when it comes to Panda. You can expose one students handle name and all that but Panda is the exception?

</p>
</br>

<p> The shady thing about this is they're supposed to inform him WHY his certs were revoked DIRECTLY with EXACT details! They just say he violated policies but NEVER specifically state what he did. 


</p>
</br>

<p> With Najam, they tell him. With Panda, they don't. 


</p>
</br>

<p> Just want you guys to let that marinate.

<p>Thanks for reading folks!

<p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!
