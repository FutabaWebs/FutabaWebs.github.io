								<p> Today’s post/mini article is going to focus on WHY we need more Women in tech and what we can do to properly address the matter, as well as what it has to do with my brand, most of which I haven’t talked about much. I’ll also dive into a bit why I’m more drawn to helping them and WHY it matters to me so much.

								</br> 
								</br>
								I’m also going to give you a little history lesson on the major role Women play in tech and the major contributions they’ve made, many of which if it were not for them we wouldn’t have most of the stuff we see in front of us today, including technology that has even improved the lives of people like me with autism and various other forms of disabilities. We have A LOT to thank them for but it doesn’t get celebrated or talked about often except for special occasions like Women’s History month.

							</br> 
								</br>
									
                                The goal of this post is to inspire women on WHY they belong in tech and WHY they should pursue a career in technology.

                        </h4>

						<p>I’ve talked about this before… but WOMEN ARE THE TRUE FOUNDERS for anything related to computing technology. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Stuff like: The first human readable programming language such as COBOL which made programming more accessible to everyone, WI-FI which we all use today, Bluetooth, even the source code for the Apollo space project which brought us to the moon for the first time, were all created by women, most of which were NEVER properly credited to them. Even the first digitization of the “computer”, based on the analytical engine by Ada Lovelace, wouldn’t have been possible without them.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>“But there are videos and history texts and-”</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Yeah, but most of it is thrown under the rug without much coverage! Women were ROBBED of the spotlight they deserved, where the impression was given that MEN did it first. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>They were known as “Refrigerator Ladies” where they were never really given credit for all the hard work they did. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>You can find out in more detail about their major contributions in tech in this article <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-women-belong-cyber-security-roy-bull-futaba-webs--mk7he/?trackingId=m4lVPPeiReWhqneImxSRyg%3D%3D&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BAALohGPbRROUB9Sex96unw%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>! I wrote for Women’s History month.</p>

                    </h4>

					<p>Ever seen a product so "unique" that you just knew you had to be apart of it!? This is where being authentic comes into play!
					</p>
				</br>

					<p> Personal brands are just that, PERSONAL! It's a reflection of your overall uniqueness and personal traits. 

					</p>
					</br>
					
					<p> WHY is this important? Here's a little analogy that I think you'll understand. Ever picked up a piece of "music" and you "felt" like it "spoke out to you"? Being authentic allows you to connect with others who share the same perspective as you!

					</p>
				</br>


					<p> For example, part of my brand is a whole "gamified" Cyber Security vibe! This allows me to connect with folks in the Cyber realm, A LOT of which recognize a lot of the iconic themes and references I drop all the time. This allows me to build a relationship and network with them, establishing what is known as "reputational" value that plays a big factor into whether they wish to support my content!

					</p>
				</br>

				<p>Even the way I write my articles is authentic, in that I'm very "insightful", dinging the light bulb in folks head that gets them thinking!

</h4>

<p>I don't really talk about this much, mostly because I don’t like making promises I can’t deliver on, but one of the main focuses for my brand in the long run will be to partner and get sponsored by places like WiCyS that help women pursue careers in Cybersecurity and technology. Part of my program, the main reason it’s taking a bit to polish it is because there WILL be a section for WOMEN in it where they get a lot more attention to make sure they’re fit to pursue whichever path in Cyber they see fit. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I also want to show up to more conferences and teach them. It’s fun!</p>
<p></p>

</br>
			
				

<p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!
