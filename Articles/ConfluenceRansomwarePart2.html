					<h4 id = "stance">The CVE-2023-22527 Exploit 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸                    </h4>

					<p>After threat actors were able to successfully compromise Confluence data servers via OGNL injection and establish RCE to the data servers, they tried the most common initial commands to check if the had access to the server, stuff like: whoami(tells you the user name on the system), net(which shows file share servers mapped to the system on the network), etc.

					</p>
				</br>


			<h4 id = "shell">Establishing a CLEAN shell 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸            </h4>

			<p>I’ve mentioned this before in one of my past research articles, but one of the most common things threat actors like to do once they gain access to the system is setup a clean shell. 

			</p>
		</br>

			<p> As security professionals, one of our main concerns is to deter this. You see, you won’t ALWAYS prevent threat actors from gaining access, BUT, when or should they do, you want to render their access as infeasible as possible. Essentially, make their access useless.  

			</p>
			</br>
			
			<p> Threat actors initially tried the classic old curl command to “wget” anydesk and run it on the system which initially failed, so they decided to use a windows binary program called “mshta” which is another means to retrieve the correct stagger they needed via metasploit in order to establish a CLEAN shell to the data server. 

			</p>
		</br>


<h4 id = "access">Access GRANTED 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸
</h4>

<p>  Within the first 10 mins of compromising Confluence data servers, threat actors did and initial check of any and all processes running on the system. 

</p>
</br>

<p>Why? For starters: to check if there are any important processes on the system that could allow them to deal more damage to the system, to check if there are any security processes running on the system, and lastly, to check if anyone else has access to said system and boot them. 

</p>
</br>

<p> It’s been assessed that prior access from other threat actors might have existed on the server, so threat actors decided to pull the plug on them to maintain clean access for themselves without any further disturbance. 

</p>
</br>

<p>Once everything was checked, they killed their own shell (in the process of said checks), connecting back to the system in order to create administrative accounts on the system, elevating their privileges.

						<a href = "#takeover5" class = "smoothScroll wow fadeInUp" style = "text-decoration: none;">

			<h4 id = "takeover5">Take Over 5 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸
			</h4>
		
			<p> A clever thing the threat actors did next, very fascinating, was they used the local account in order to RDP into admin areas of access, even going as far as to take advantage of the trusted system on the network they’ve compromised, leveraging SoftPerfects network scanner, using it against them. 

			</p>
			</br>

            <p> In simpler terms, they used their own security scanners against them to find all targets on the network, a trusted tool whose probes won’t be blocked on the network. This is what we would call Living off the land, where threat actors bypass detection systems by using ONLY what is trusted by the network itself. 

			</p>
			</br>

            <p> How do you defend against this? Well, it’s quite simple. Not every system should be trusted to do certain things. If you detect a system that has no need to run said scans, block the probes!

			</p>
			</br>

            <p> How did they get the credentials to do this in case they might have needed it? Remember Mimikatz? Yeah, they used it in order to scope out and enumerate all needed credentials, allowing them to do anything they want with administrative privileges!

			</p>
			</br>
			
						
						<h4 id = "rclone">Rclone’s Turn 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸
						</h4>

					<p>Next, threat actors leveraged data backups by enumerating Veeam credentials via a powershell script, which allowed them to excavate all files from the server via Rclone, a tool designed to clone and transfer all files from a file system remotely. 

					</p>
				</br>
				Essentially they created their own File sharing server, and then cloned the files there using Rclone. 

					</p>
					</br>


<h4 id = "lockbit">The LockBit Exploit 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸
</h4>

<p>Once threat actors fully cloned all the files from the server, the next thing they did was deploy the ransomware. They did this using LockBit against them, a FDE encryption at rest algorithm that encrypts all files on the system upon shutdown, preventing threat actors from utilizing said data.
 

</p>
</br>

<p> They did this in a clever way by leveraging PDQ, a deployment software system, in order to fully deploy the ransomware script via SMB file shares. That way whenever anyone accessed the SMB file share servers, they wouldn’t suspect a thing, executing the ransomware exploit!


</p>
</br>

<p> In total time the exploit took about 2 hours to complete!

</p>
</br>

<p>Thanks for reading folks!

<p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!
