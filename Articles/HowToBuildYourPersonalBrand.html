						<h2 id = "Article"> 🎃 How to Build Your Personal Brand?  </h2>
						<h4 id = "endgoal">What's your end goal? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>When building a personal brand or any business (should you stray that path), the first thing you need to ask yourself is, "What do I plan to do with my brand?" 
						</p>
						</br>
						
						<p> You see, A LOT of people are all brain no aim. They'll have all these ideas, have all the smarts in the world, but will lack the ability to FOCUS on a particular area their brand should be specializing in. It's ok to specialize in more than one thing, which I happen to be doing, BUT, there needs to be some form of correlation otherwise you'll run into a situation where folks will question your brand identify, such as "What... do you guys do?". 

						</p>
					</br>


						<p>A good example of all of which I'm talking about can be found in one of my past articles <a href = "" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>, where I talk about the goal for MY brand and all the types of stuff I do for it!

						</p>
					</br>

                    <p>Having an objective for your brand will also make it easier to build out the overall schematics for it!
                    </p>
                </br>


					
					<h4 id = "authentic">Be Authentic! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸
                    </h4>

					<p>Ever seen a product so "unique" that you just knew you had to be apart of it!? This is where being authentic comes into play!
					</p>
				</br>

					<p> Personal brands are just that, PERSONAL! It's a reflection of your overall uniqueness and personal traits. 

					</p>
					</br>
					
					<p> WHY is this important? Here's a little analogy that I think you'll understand. Ever picked up a piece of "music" and you "felt" like it "spoke out to you"? Being authentic allows you to connect with others who share the same perspective as you!

					</p>
				</br>


					<p> For example, part of my brand is a whole "gamified" Cyber Security vibe! This allows me to connect with folks in the Cyber realm, A LOT of which recognize a lot of the iconic themes and references I drop all the time. This allows me to build a relationship and network with them, establishing what is known as "reputational" value that plays a big factor into whether they wish to support my content!

					</p>
				</br>

				<p>Even the way I write my articles is authentic, in that I'm very "insightful", dinging the light bulb in folks head that gets them thinking!


				</p>
			</br>



<h4 id = "community">Build a community! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸
</h4>

<p>  Relationship building is the next step when it comes to networking! 

</p>
</br>

<p>When you're building a personal brand, don't forget the emphasis on PERSONAL! If you want people to support you, you have to be able to CONNECT with them on a PERSONAL level! Failing to do so will have them question whether or not they should support your brand!
</p>
</br>

<p>Me personally, I only engage and support those that interact with their community and GENUINELY mean it!

</p>
</br>


<p>If you've been paying close attention to all the Discord stuff I've been doing lately, my goal is to further connect with folks by chatting and engaging with them on a regular basis, as well as learning some more neat stuff about me, further relating to them!
</p>

            </h4>

			<p>I can't say this works for all platforms, but IT SURE AS HECK works for LinkedIn! 
			</p>
		</br>

			<p> 🎃 Commenting and Engaging 

			</p>
			</br>
			
			<p> Commenting and Engaging, SPECIFICALLY on others posts allows you to establish some overall presence!
			</p>
		</br>


			<p>When I was trying to get my name known in the Cyber Security field, I would comment under any and all major Cyber Security posts, even going as to challenge and enlighten those that have been at it longer than I have! This lead to my name getting seen and folks wanting to connect with me to hear more of what I had to say!
			</p>
		</br>


        <p>  The kicker to this? Not only do the original posters SEE your name, but so do the people in their comment section, folks related to them should they interact with you, and so on.

        </p>
        </br>

        <p> 🎃 Comment and Engage on your own stuff

        </p>
        </br>

        <p> Ever wondered WHY I always comment and react to my own posts, as well as any comments I place in them? 


        </p>
        </br>

        <p> LinkedIn ensures that ANYONE and EVERYONE you're connected to can SEE what you comment and react to! This includes YOUR posts as well! You can capitalize on this on top of what I've previously mentioned in order to get some serious traction! 



        </p>
        </br>

        <p> 🎃 Post regularly 

        </p>
        </br>

        <p> This might not come as a shocker, but YES, post REGULARLY! The LinkedIn algorithm as well as any other form of social media favors those that are CONSTANTLY active! How can you get seen if you don't post often?

        </p>
        </br>

        <p> 🎃 Stop caring if a post flops!

        </p>
        </br>

        <p> One of the biggest issues as to why folks don't post on a consistent schedule is due to the fear of a post not doing well, OR, whether or not they believe people will care about it! 

        </p>
        </br>

        <p> Here's the thing, and even I still go through this, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO IGNORE THE SH*T out of you in the beginning! You might feel like you're not getting anywhere, but I PROMISE you, if you stop advertising yourself and putting in the work then NO ONE will know your name.

        </p>
        </br>

        <p> Me keeping it consistent with my brand has lead to me getting featured into all sorts of stuff and overall being a TRUSTED voice in my community, whose words INFLUENCE people when spoken!

        </p>
        </br>

        <p> All of which I've stated could also relate to selling a product should you be doing so!

        </p>
        </br>
				
			
			<h4 id = "capitalize">Capitalize 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸
			</h4>
			
			<p>By now you should have a general swing of things for how you plan to run your personal brand. Take from that and CAPTITALIZE on it in order to gain more exposure and improve overall aspects of your brand that are KEY objectives for it. Interconnect and build on what you have to further improve it's overall foundation essentially!
			</p>
			</br>
			
			<p> Nonetheless, I took a look at the core policies, which you can read here…. And…. well…. Panda didn’t violate anything nor is there a single screenshot of him cheating during the exam as Heath claims. The only person he had visible proof of doing so that he CONFIDENTLY exposes without question was the student I mentioned earlier, “Najam UI Saqib”.
			</p>
			</br>
			
				

<p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!
