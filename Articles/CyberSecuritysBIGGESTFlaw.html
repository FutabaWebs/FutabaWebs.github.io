						<h2 id = "Article"> 🎃 Cyber Security's BIGGEST Flaw!  </h2>
						<h4 id = "disclosures">Public Disclosures Hurt Us 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>Ever see the latest news on MAJOR security breaches or recent white papers from security researches that get publicly disclosed online? Yeah, THIS, although that information is nice, is part of the problem as to WHY threat actors are constantly able to adapt and stay two steps ahead of us. It also gives threat actors INGENIOUS ideas on how to piggyback off of recent breaches and evolve them, sharing that information with each other. Don’t even get me started on “living off the land” stuff that becomes possible when we “talk” too much. </p>

						<p></p>

						<p>When you disclose PUBLICLY HOW certain breaches took place or how to prevent them on a technical level, you’re telling threat actors STEP BY STEP on HOW to breach your security systems. It's even worse since we have DEDICATED platforms that help fill threat actors on all this juicy information. </p>

						<p></p>

						<p>A good example of what I mean by this, and this is no insult to anyone, would be the beloved Wiz. As much as I LOVE Wiz and a lot of other Security focused places that disclose Security research information to everyone, time and time again I’ve been able to get full in depth information on recent exploit techniques, where, if I were a threat actor, could allow me to devise said exploits against other infrastructures.</p>

						<p></p>

						<p>Even without places like Wiz that do all of this, it’s still mandated by law that breach disclosure occurs.</p>

						<p></p>

						<p>Now…. how to handle disclosures? Well… to be rather blunt…. Sum it up as quick as possible. No need for a diagram and all that. I know this sounds bizarre, but hear me out. It’s the job of SECURITY professionals to break down and study HOW a breach took place with just an overall summary and devise mechanisms of their own in order to defend against it, even apply needed patches if necessary for all systems. This of course would REQUIRE companies to have a DEDICATED budget for proper Cyber Security procedures which most still sleep on.</p>

						<p></p>

						<p>Now, what do I mean by “summing it up as quickly as possible”? Ever seen a CVE that just dropped and you tried replicating it but have no idea how? THIS is what I mean by that. The CVE simply explains HOW the breach occurs without full in depth information on to the tee things, leaving it up to Security professionals to test and check against it on their own and figure out how to defend against it, OR, if you’re a threat actor, figure out how to replicate the exploit (which threat actors aren’t too keen on sharing how to do since they profit off of selling that information).</p>

            </h4>

			<p>Now this might rub a few the wrong way.. BUT…. WE DO HAVE SHORTAGE OF CYBER SECURITY TALENT. Not by numbers, NO, there is plenty of that. The PROBLEM is we don’t have the RIGHT talent in the RIGHT places. We have people that SHOULD be in Cyber, NOT in Cyber, and people that shouldn't in Cyber if that makes sense.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Cyber Security isn’t a game, there’s A LOT on the line should an infrastructure FAIL to prevent a breach: reputational value, financial assets, and of course overall jobs that are on the line that can be impacted should financial assets be impacted from security breaches. Not even just the company itself, but the very end user data hosted in them puts said individuals at risk which can lead to stuff like identity theft and a lot more.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>A consistent trend, as disappointed as I am to say this… Is we have folks in Cyber that don’t “understand” security. Most of them know how to regurgitate what they “know” on Security related subject matters, maybe even use a good chunk of the tools to defend, even attack if possible (if they even, since most pentests are being automated now a days), but this doesn’t mean they “understand” security. </p>

			<p></p>

			<p>A lot of this is due to the movement of not having to be “technical” to work in Cyber or over prioritization on “soft skills” which leads to a lot of folks that aren’t technical enough to apply basic to advanced Security frameworks/procedures, all of which is more prevalent when dealing with leadership roles like CISO’s for example. This leads to MANY recurring situations where security breaches, basic ones that can EASILY be prevented.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>How to find the right talent? We already have. The problem is Cyber Security has become a celebrity thing where only the cool kids get into the club. It’s become less about security and more about ego.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>It’s also problematic that budgets simply don’t “exist” for said talent if that makes sense, rather, a refusal to make them.</p>


			<p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!
