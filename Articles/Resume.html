						<h2> 🎃 ABOUT FUTABA_WEBS </h2>
						<h4 id = "Founder"> Founder at Futaba_Webs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 | Cyber Security Professional | Penetration Tester | Cyber Security Engineer & Researcher | Software & Electrical Engineer | Reverse Engineer | Gray & Purple Hat Hacker </h4>

						<p> Self-Taught Cyber Security Professional with a background in Software Engineering, IT Technical Support, Security Engineering, and proficiency in Electrical engineering and Reverse Engineering. 
						</p>


						<p> I have a love and passion for offensive security. I reverse engineer various core API’s and technologies in order to explore and fabricate new ideas that will make my projects come to life. 
						</p>

						
						<p> I use my Software Engineering skills to design custom exploits and penetration testing tools, and CTF servers that demonstrate my Security Engineering skills and ingenious ingenuity. 

						</p>


						<p> My Electrical Engineering skills allow me to devise various custom tools such as keyboard injection exploits that manipulate the virtual keyboard API of a system in order to inject payloads and bypass security measures for security testing, some with the ability to write their own code, which I use to extend further C/C++ Win32API and LinuxAPI exploits along with python scripts.
						</p>


						<p> On top of being proficient in C/C++ I’m also proficient in 13 programming languages in total, my main ones being: C/C++, Python3, Bash, SQL, HTML/CSS/JS, PHP, and of course a bit of Powershell scripting as well. 
						</p>

						<p> 
							My IT skills are on par with level 4 tier experience. I use my reverse engineering skills in order to deduce probable causes and solutions for technical problems. 

						</p>

						<p> 
							Reverse engineering is my specialty and is how I learn. Given my level of ingenuity, I was allowed to operate above my tier level and demonstrate my skill sets to the fullest and solve lots of complex technical problems at the companies that I worked at, including the infamous Pfizer Pharmaceutical company, which I have thorough documentation of in my research portfolio.

						</p>

						<p> 
							My skill sets won’t disappoint you! Check out my work and my research. I take pride in what I do as a professional hacker.

I got to work with tools such as: dirbuster, gobuster, dirsearcher for web server enumeration, Burp Suite for brute forcing web application login pages and pitch fork brute forcing to bypass login timeout mechanics, Fuzzing, and various forms of critical vulnerability assessment tools such as nikto, and additional tools like httrack to further analyze any and all files that come from web server applications ton parse them for sensitive information during a pentest. I even participated in advanced high level forensics challenges that involved Python programming, data compressions/decompressions, database files, and even data encryption. I also got experience with stuff like hashcat and john the ripper for cracking passwords and hashes via the use of word lists, as well as cookie session hijacking and working with robot.txt files from web applications in order to uncover various site maps that could allow me to secure sensitive data.</p>

                        <p>I took advantage of our reservation system to stay a head EVERYDAY, even arriving an hour early, so I could focus on optimizing high quality end user support without any distractions: Performing room sweeps, Staying ahead of tickets, contacting clients to further plan ahead support for them, as well as coordinating with the various coordinator admins to stay ahead of future bookings and scheduling, including room tests for the meetings in advance and any other specifications they might need for the meeting and such, and testing trouble shooting anomalies to prepare for onsite support.</p>
                        
                        <p></p>
                        
                        <p>Training the staff and faculty on how to use the equipment was one of my biggest strategies in that it made my job even easier, in that I could focus on the people that really do need the support. This thinned out the number of rooms I had to check up on, and reduced 80 tickets to sometimes 40 tickets, saving me so much time to work on other things and focus on supporting major meetings, as well as gaining a healthy client based, and of course getting more tickets in since I had time to help more people. raising my ticket count higher. </p>
