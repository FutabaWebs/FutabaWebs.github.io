This is extremely bad considering the situation and current accusations stacked against them.</p> <p></p> <p>As of the time of writing this article, and I'm sorry to say this.... Heath Adams has OFFICALLY blocked me on LinkedIn. SO... if ANY, and I mean ANY of the posts I tag in this article, should they be redacted or change on his end, you know why! My credibility is HIGH and I speak ONLY the truth!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>HOWEVER, if by some sheer luck he does finally speak out regarding the situation with CONCRETE evidence, I'll happily retract everything in this article. I doubt it, BUT, let's move on!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What’s been going on regarding the TCM cert revoke situation 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>🎃 TCM is basically being accused of revoking someone’s certs they PAID for because they were being trolled by them in their Discord server via memes, jokes that were essentially harmless.</p> <p></p> <p>Link to the Tweet that went viral can be found here, which has over 337K views and 69 retweets.</p> <p></p> <p>Although the Tweet censors the name of the Discord member, it’s basically the student in question that Heath Adams claims cheated during their exam which he shows ZERO proof of.</p> <p></p> <p>Heath claims the student violated TCM’s policies and sought external help during their exam, but when asked to disclose this information, even a censored version of it, he chalks it up to "privacy policies" and refuses to disclose ANYTHING, and he does, it's misleading which I’ll talk about in a bit.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">TCM’s Stance on the matter 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This is an official response! from Heath Adams, founder and CEO of TCM Security.</p> <p></p> <p>In his initial response post, and I want you to be mindful of this later on in the article, HIS words exactly, was that he didn't know anything about the meme situation everyone’s been talking about. Apparently he didn't know the meme existed.</p> <p></p> <p>As you can tell, it sounds fishy because along with everything else that’s been going on, they’ve been refusing to disclose ANYTHING or provide SOLID proof of what’s been happening.</p> <p></p> <p>You can find out more about what I mean in this post here! from one of his official staff members that also does the same thing, where he defends TCM, but doesn’t disclose anything to clear up all the confusion that’s been going on with them on their end. Repost with my overall thoughts for it can be found here!.</p> <p></p> <p>Shortly after, Heath Updates us on the situation in another post, but AGAIN, STILL didn’t answer any questions DIRECTLY with EVIDENCE regarding the matter. I want you to pay CLOSE attention to this, as it becomes a concerning trend.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Suspicions About Heath and TCM 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The BIGGEST suspicion about TCM right now is how they’re handling the situation, SPECIFICALLY, their unwillingness to disclose ANY information regarding the matter, more so since they’re claiming a student cheated but refuses to disclose screenshots of any kind due to “privacy policies”.</p> <p></p> <p>The kicker, and something strange? They happily disclose a few Discord messages from a student named “Najam UI Saqib” who DID in fact cheat during his examination, which led to his certs getting revoked. HOWEVER, this was only due to his post that went viral which Heath HAD to respond to, otherwise it would just raise more suspicions that he’s hiding something.</p> <p></p> <p>NOW, he DOES in fact respond with OFFICIAL Discord server screenshots of what happened and Najam cheating and him blocking TCM staff and avoiding the situation. It gets SOOO bad that Najam actually DELETES his entire post regarding the matter after it went viral.</p> <p></p> <p>I was ECSTATIC, BUT, as you can tell it felt a little “strange”. Why? Because TCM was UNWILLING many times to disclose ANYTHING, and now all of a sudden they’re dropping screenshots and spilling the beans? Something just felt off about it, and guess what… I WAS RIGHT!</p> <p></p> <p>You can find out more about that here!</p> <p></p> <p>HOWEVER, Heath raised a HUGE red flag when he messaged me directly explaining it “wasn’t” the student he was talking about regarding his second follow up post. It’s strange because now apparently there were TWO students even though he never mentions that once in any of his posts. He led us under the impression that ONE student that cheated.</p> <p></p> <p>This did lead to me having to revise my post MULTIPLE times, even a few folks commenting they were still confused regarding the situation…. And to be honest… I was confused as well.</p> <p></p> <p>Something funny too, whenever ANYONE questioned what happened, Heath would BAN or BLOCK them RIGHT AWAY! He even kept an eye on people he felt would talk and looked them up on LinkedIn and blocked them right away, myself included, even if we didn't mention the companies name or his name.</p> <p></p> <p>You can find out what I mean in these two instances here!</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Instance1!</p> <p>🎃 Instance2!</p> <p></p> <p>There’s more of course, BUT, you get the point.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Heath Lied About Not Knowing the meme in question 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>In Heath’s first initial post regarding the matter, and I want you to think clearly about what I said before regarding his EXACT words, he mentions VERY CLEARLY he knows NOTHING about the meme everyone was talking about.</p> <p></p> <p>Sadly…. That too was also a lie. I have screenshots of him admitting and acting childish about it which is in the process of being released upon further notice.</p> <p></p> <p>The sad part about this, is he also lies about banning Panda, which panda confirms with DIRECT evidence that it was in fact Heath that DID ban him from the Discord server.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">TCM Revised Their Policies 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Shortly after the situation, TCM revised its policies which I found a little suspicious. Why? Because if it suddenly “changes” and no one is aware, it could lead to a situation where Heath could say stuff like this (meming) calls for a cert revoke. I’m not saying he would do that, BUT, it did scratch that part of my brain.</p> <p></p> <p>Nonetheless, I took a look at the core policies, which you can read here…. And…. well…. Panda didn’t violate anything nor is there a single screenshot of him cheating during the exam as Heath claims. The only person he had visible proof of doing so that he CONFIDENTLY exposes without question was the student I mentioned earlier, “Najam UI Saqib”.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Truth? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The REAL victim of the whole TCM situation… and I’m sorry to have to even say this… A LOT of the current evidence on deck DOES point towards their certs being revoked for speculated reasons, A LOT of which Heath admits to in his own Discord messages under his handle name.</p> <p></p> <p>You can find out more about the what's been going on via screen pics here!</p> <p></p> <p>There might be a further witness for the whole situation, BUT, I need her consent first before I feature her in the article. TRUST me on this, IF she does, and she releases further screenshots, it will be added to the massive archive of PHOTOGRAPHIC evidence I have for this article. You'll of course be kept up to date on this!</p> <p></p> <p>The student I’m talking about is named “ExecPanda”. If you go back to that twitter screenshot, you’ll see snippets of his profile pic exposed which IS an EXACT match!</p> <p></p> <p>He was kind enough to reach out to me via Discord and explain the situation to me in FULL detail with PROOF! He was honest about the whole thing, even the memeing and trolling on the server which DID call for the Discord ban. HOWEVER, this didn't justify his certifications being taken away from him, nor did it explain WHY they were taken away from him.</p> <p></p> <p>For those that might be wondering, since this has been aired out in the open, regarding the "joke/fake" cert situation with Panda, which he did admit to, this happens after his certs were revoked and removed without warning, where he was placed under investigation, also without warning. He assumes they're gone and have been revoked since he reached out to folks in the Discord server, most saying they still had theirs. This is WHY he does this. He also reaches out to staff formally and pops the question on whether or not they were revoked about an hour later after he does this, from which they CONFIRM his certs were revoked!</p> <p></p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Is TCM Still Reliable? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>To be very honest.. No… not after this.</p> <p></p> <p>This article was kind of hard to write, since I looked up to Heath Adams when I was in my earlier days as a hacker.</p> <p></p> <p>I spoke good faith about him MANY times, even featured him in some of my past articles for people that wanted to break into Cyber, but he dropped the ball on this one.</p> <p></p> <p>He had the potential to become one of the greats when it came to Cyber Security training and industry certs. Now I have to take back what I said and revise a lot of that stuff.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">After Thoughts 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This is going to be a bone chilling point I'm going to make.</p> <p></p> <p>Heath and everyone at TCM lectures us and says we should do our "research" yet prevents us from doing so.</p> <p></p> <p>The funny thing about what they're doing is when you prevent folks from researching it only leads to more speculation which can get out of hand.</p> <p></p> <p>It's even more sketchy since he openly discloses Najam but hides everything when it comes to Panda. You can expose one students handle name and all that but Panda is the exception?</p> <p></p> <p>The funny thing about what they're doing is when you prevent folks from researching it only leads to more speculation which can get out of hand.</p> <p></p> <p>The shady thing about this is they're supposed to inform him WHY his certs were revoked DIRECTLY with EXACT details! They just say he violated policies but NEVER specifically state what he did.</p> <p></p> <p>With Najam, they tell him. With Panda, they don't.</p> <p></p> <p>Just want you guys to let that marinate.</p> <p></p> <p>Thanks for reading folks!</p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!</p> <p></p> <p> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸</p> </br></br>`;

This is crucial for today's job market since it's more along the lines of "It's not WHAT you know, but WHO you know".</p> <p></p> <p>Building a personal brand allows you to network and find the RIGHT people that will take a chance on you! It's what got me where I am today and is what is allowing me to expand my opportunities!</p> <p></p> <p>You'll learn a lot of key stuff that could help you on your Cyber Security journey!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What's your end goal? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>When building a personal brand or any business (should you stray that path), the first thing you need to ask yourself is, "What do I plan to do with my brand?"</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>You see, A LOT of people are all brain no aim. They'll have all these ideas, have all the smarts in the world, but will lack the ability to FOCUS on a particular area their brand should be specializing in. It's ok to specialize in more than one thing, which I happen to be doing, BUT, there needs to be some form of correlation otherwise you'll run into a situation where folks will question your brand identify, such as "What... do you guys do?".</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>A good example of all of which I'm talking about can be found in one of my past articles here, where I talk about the goal for MY brand and all the types of stuff I do for it!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Having an objective for your brand will also make it easier to build out the overall schematics for it!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Be Authentic! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Ever seen a product so "unique" that you just knew you had to be apart of it!? This is where being authentic comes into play!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Personal brands are just that, PERSONAL! It's a reflection of your overall uniqueness and personal traits.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>WHY is this important? Here's a little analogy that I think you'll understand. Ever picked up a piece of "music" and you "felt" like it "spoke out to you"? Being authentic allows you to connect with others who share the same perspective as you!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>For example, part of my brand is a whole "gamified" Cyber Security vibe! This allows me to connect with folks in the Cyber realm, A LOT of which recognize a lot of the iconic themes and references I drop all the time. This allows me to build a relationship and network with them, establishing what is known as "reputational" value that plays a big factor into whether they wish to support my content!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Even the way I write my articles is authentic, in that I'm very "insightful", dinging the light bulb in folks head that gets them thinking!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Build a community! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Relationship building is the next step when it comes to networking!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>When you're building a personal brand, don't forget the emphasis on PERSONAL! If you want people to support you, you have to be able to CONNECT with them on a PERSONAL level! Failing to do so will have them question whether or not they should support your brand!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Me personally, I only engage and support those that interact with their community and GENUINELY mean it!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you've been paying close attention to all the Discord stuff I've been doing lately, my goal is to further connect with folks by chatting and engaging with them on a regular basis, as well as learning some more neat stuff about me, further relating to them!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How To Get Seen? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I can't say this works for all platforms, but IT SURE AS HECK works for LinkedIn!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Commenting and Engaging</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Commenting and Engaging, SPECIFICALLY on others posts allows you to establish some overall presence!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>When I was trying to get my name known in the Cyber Security field, I would comment under any and all major Cyber Security posts, even going as to challenge and enlighten those that have been at it longer than I have! This lead to my name getting seen and folks wanting to connect with me to hear more of what I had to say!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The kicker to this? Not only do the original posters SEE your name, but so do the people in their comment section, folks related to them should they interact with you, and so on.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Comment and Engage on your own stuff</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Ever wondered WHY I always comment and react to my own posts, as well as any comments I place in them?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>LinkedIn ensures that ANYONE and EVERYONE you're connected to can SEE what you comment and react to! This includes YOUR posts as well! You can capitalize on this on top of what I've previously mentioned in order to get some serious traction!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Post regularly</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>This might not come as a shocker, but YES, post REGULARLY! The LinkedIn algorithm as well as any other form of social media favors those that are CONSTANTLY active! How can you get seen if you don't post often?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Stop caring if a post flops!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>One of the biggest issues as to why folks don't post on a consistent schedule is due to the fear of a post not doing well, OR, whether or not they believe people will care about it!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Here's the thing, and even I still go through this, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO IGNORE THE SH*T out of you in the beginning! You might feel like you're not getting anywhere, but I PROMISE you, if you stop advertising yourself and putting in the work then NO ONE will know your name.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Me keeping it consistent with my brand has lead to me getting featured into all sorts of stuff and overall being a TRUSTED voice in my community, whose words INFLUENCE people when spoken!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>All of which I've stated could also relate to selling a product should you be doing so!</p> <p></p> <p></p> </br></br> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/asian1.avif" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Capitalize 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>By now you should have a general swing of things for how you plan to run your personal brand. Take from that and CAPTITALIZE on it in order to gain more exposure and improve overall aspects of your brand that are KEY objectives for it. Interconnect and build on what you have to further improve it's overall foundation essentially!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Nonetheless, I took a look at the core policies, which you can read here…. And…. well…. Panda didn’t violate anything nor is there a single screenshot of him cheating during the exam as Heath claims. The only person he had visible proof of doing so that he CONFIDENTLY exposes without question was the student I mentioned earlier, “Najam UI Saqib”.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up!

She also does some cool stuff regarding drone security and a lot more. </p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What/Who is Ex Machina Parlor? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now, what is Ex Machina Parlor and what is their goal?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Ever seen the Hackerspace in "Watch Dogs 2" where Marcus, Wrench, and various members of the team work on all sorts of projects, sharing and collabing resources? What if I told you we could have something like that!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>What if I told you they could make all of that ACCESSIBLE and AFFORDABLE to you much like with HTB and TCM’s stuff? Do you still follow?! GOOD! Keep reading, it only gets better, PROMISE!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Part of Ex Machina's goal is to create a hackerspace where you can visit either PHYSICALLY or VIRTUALLY, and participate in their overall Cyber range, allowing you to grow as Hackers and Cyber Security professionals.</p> <p></p> <p>Essentially Ex Machina's goal is to turn the big TWO, HTB and TCM Security into the big THREE. There's no telling what's possible if they actually manage to pull this off? Not only will you be able to learn the basics from HTB and TCM, BUT, when you’re ready to begin APPLYING the knowledge, you’ll have Ex Machina to help you step up your game!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Imagine stuff like SEIM, SOAR, MITRE setups, even azure active directory stuff you'd probably need to purchase a subscription and a lot more, along with a ton of other stuff all accessible to you now! Imagine wanting to learn how to code, or get HANDS on training with Robotics, stuff you'd HAVE to spend A LOT of money on in order to even do the thing, also available to you now?! This also goes for PHYSICAL hacking tools and a lot more! Imagine all that being accessible to you in one or more PHYSICAL spaces! This is essentially what Hacker culture SHOULD feel like and is what they’re going for!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Oh, did I mention folks there are MEGA friendly and you’ll get CLOSE up guidance from them? That’s mentorship basically!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Wanna help them succeed? Well, their non-profit, so in other words, contribute what you can in order to ensure you as well as everyone else that needs PRACTICAL, both HANDS on as well as VIRTUAL training. Give them a follow and join their discord server to see what their all about!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Link to their discord server can be found here!</p> <p></p> <p>The main goal of FREE resources/training is so folks can bypass the paywall barrier, allowing them to have just as much as a chance compared to those holding a 4 year degree along with certs.

THAT, is what I mean by “centralized”.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is CVE-2023-22527? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>It's an RCE/RDP exploit that can be pulled off via OGNL injection which is a popular java based expression framework that can be found in the Confluence infrastructure.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The exploit takes advantage of the centralized aspect of the system, a SMB collective, that can be accessed by various companies that up and funnel all their data so they can share it with one another.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If a threat actor manages to leverage the system they'd be able to infect it with spoofed versions of the original that are obfuscated with malware, pivoting into a botnet and a lot more.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Metasploit? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Metasploit is an offensive security penetration testing framework that can be used for a variety of penetration testing methodologies: web application, networking, C&C/botneting, mobile hacking, etc. It’s a multi-tool power house in case you haven’t noticed, and has left a legacy, where tools like SET, routersploit and even kali nethunter mimic in terms of overall terminal functional and design. It also has one of the best well maintained database archives of any and all exploits that exist in its database. The code written and stored in it is beyond our deserving.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>In some cases it can be used to install malware on a system depending on how well the exploit is performed and the level of privileges on the system.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>You can learn more about Metasploit in one of my past articles here! Full Patreon exclusive video in full details that can be purchased from me if you want to learn all the PRACTICAL basics really quickly!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is MimiKatz? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p> MimiKatz is a beloved and commonly used tool for hackers to leverage various credentials on a system, specifically Windows ones, allowing them to do stuff like: privilege escalation, pass the hash, essentially uncovering any plain text files that would have credentials, allowing threat actors to gain admin rights. </p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is PDQ? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>It's essentially a tool that is used in order to install various files and software packages on a system.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Why's this bad? Well, for starters, if you manage to to leverage a system, you can install and upgrade any form of software you want on it remotely. In the hands of a threat actor you can infect a singular trusted system, even a redundant one, and install any and all needed tools, infecting a network even further as well as any SMB file shares it might contain like in this case.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is AnyDesk? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Ever heard of "TeamViewer"? AnyDesk is just another form of a commercial GUI based RDP tool that can be used to access another system, making it seamless to install any and all forms of malware on a system.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Remember that little bit on how I explained that Confluence data centers are centralized and HOW they can be compromised?</p> <p></p> <p>With AnyDesk, not only can you get a remote connection established to a system, BUT, you can also get a GUI based one, taking advantage of infrastructures that already use and or trust it in the process as well.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>With AnyDesk, not only can you get a remote connection established to a system, BUT, you can also get a GUI based one, taking advantage of infrastructures that already use and or trust it in the process as well.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Using anydesk allows you to: Check for sensitive files using mimikatz more accurately, input admin credentials and give permissions for them, run PDQ, and a lot more. Think of it like LITERALLY being able to not only see someone’s screen BUT, you’re able to control it as if you were there. The ultimate form of a pwned system.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is LockBit? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>LockBit is a form of data at rest symmetric encryption algorithm that's used in order to encrypt and secure all files on a windows file system, rendering it infeasible to threat actors that either remotely access the drive OR, physically by simply stealing it.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>This article was kind of hard to write, since I looked up to Heath Adams when I was in my earlier days as a hacker.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I spoke good faith about him MANY times, even featured him in some of my past articles for people that wanted to break into Cyber, but he dropped the ball on this one.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>He had the potential to become one of the greats when it came to Cyber Security training and industry certs. Now I have to take back what I said and revise a lot of that stuff.</p> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How is LockBit Ransomware? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Ransomware is essentially what LockBit does, BUT, with malicious intent!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Imagine if a threat actor leveraged your system and encrypted it without your consent, holding the key? THIS is what I mean. LockBit was basically used in a more malicious manner which becomes easily feasible ESPECIALLY more so since it's a "tool" already made that has access and can be used to accurately target files on the system, or the whole system itself.</p> </br></br> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What are SMB's? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>SMB's, a term commonly used for Windows file share systems, uses the FTP protocol to host an accessible file share server that can be accessed by various systems on either a local or remote network to access data.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Think of it like this, imagine you had all your: pictures, folders, documents, etc, and all of that was open and free via a port on your system to be shared with others remotely. This is what a SMB essentially is! SMB is again specifically a term for Windows based file shares, but overall these are classified as “FTP Services”, which stands for “File Transfer Protocol” service.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Rclone? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Rclone is what allowed threat actors to escavate files from all systems associated with the Confluence file share, syncing it to remote systems on their end, leaving the encrypted ones behind and the clean ones only with them, as well as the key they have.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>You can find out more about rclone here!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>- The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸</p> </br></br>`;

If you have any further questions the best way to reach me is via my discord server.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/AttackTree.jpeg" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The CVE-2023-22527 Exploit 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p> After threat actors were able to successfully compromise Confluence data servers via OGNL injection and establish RCE to the data servers, they tried the most common initial commands to check if the had access to the server, stuff like: whoami(tells you the user name on the system), net(which shows file share servers mapped to the system on the network), etc. </p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Establishing a CLEAN shell 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I’ve mentioned this before in one of my past research articles, but one of the most common things threat actors like to do once they gain access to the system is setup a clean shell.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>As security professionals, one of our main concerns is to deter this. You see, you won’t ALWAYS prevent threat actors from gaining access, BUT, when or should they do, you want to render their access as infeasible as possible. Essentially, make their access useless.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Threat actors initially tried the classic old curl command to “wget” anydesk and run it on the system which initially failed, so they decided to use a windows binary program called “mshta” which is another means to retrieve the correct stagger they needed via metasploit in order to establish a CLEAN shell to the data server.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Access GRANTED 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Within the first 10 mins of compromising Confluence data servers, threat actors did and initial check of any and all processes running on the system.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Why? For starters: to check if there are any important processes on the system that could allow them to deal more damage to the system, to check if there are any security processes running on the system, and lastly, to check if anyone else has access to said system and boot them.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>It’s been assessed that prior access from other threat actors might have existed on the server, so threat actors decided to pull the plug on them to maintain clean access for themselves without any further disturbance.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Once everything was checked, they killed their own shell (in the process of said checks), connecting back to the system in order to create administrative accounts on the system, elevating their privileges.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Take Over 5 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A clever thing the threat actors did next, very fascinating, was they used the local account in order to RDP into admin areas of access, even going as far as to take advantage of the trusted system on the network they’ve compromised, leveraging SoftPerfects network scanner, using it against them.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>In simpler terms, they used their own security scanners against them to find all targets on the network, a trusted tool whose probes won’t be blocked on the network. This is what we would call Living off the land, where threat actors bypass detection systems by using ONLY what is trusted by the network itself.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>How do you defend against this? Well, it’s quite simple. Not every system should be trusted to do certain things. If you detect a system that has no need to run said scans, block the probes!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>How did they get the credentials to do this in case they might have needed it? Remember Mimikatz? Yeah, they used it in order to scope out and enumerate all needed credentials, allowing them to do anything they want with administrative privileges!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Rclone’s Turn 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Next, threat actors leveraged data backups by enumerating Veeam credentials via a powershell script, which allowed them to excavate all files from the server via Rclone, a tool designed to clone and transfer all files from a file system remotely.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Essentially they created their own File sharing server, and then cloned the files there using Rclone.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The LockBit Exploit 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Once threat actors fully cloned all the files from the server, the next thing they did was deploy the ransomware. They did this using LockBit against them, a FDE encryption at rest algorithm that encrypts all files on the system upon shutdown, preventing threat actors from utilizing said data.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>They did this in a clever way by leveraging PDQ, a deployment software system, in order to fully deploy the ransomware script via SMB file shares. That way whenever anyone accessed the SMB file share servers, they wouldn’t suspect a thing, executing the ransomware exploit!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>In total time the exploit took about 2 hours to complete!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Thanks for reading folks!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up!

I've talked a bit about it before in one of my previous posts, but figured I'd give a recap as well as some additional ideas that'll be cooking up. Some of them are already in rotation, so I'll indicate which one's are new, and which ones are already instated. </p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The DANGER!

Series is I raise more awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>This series includes a FREE 2 page article, the paid version being an additional page along with a long full in depth video (IF one is made for it).</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Exploit Guides (Patreon only) 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> </br></br> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/exploitseries.jpeg" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> <p>There's a difference between a simulation and the REAL deal!

I’ve been a bit vague on that for a while now, often dropping breadcrumbs here and there, mostly due to not wanting to make empty promises, but considering how things are going so far and with some of my latest announcements, I figured now's the best time to discuss all of that with you. </p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">White Paper Research 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> One of the main aspects of my brand is the white paper research I develop, where I create article and video based material that focus on offensive security and many other skill traits I happen to possess that can be applied to “PRACTICAL” hacking on a fundamental level. It’s basically research material that can be more realistically applied to the real world vs most ethical material that tends to be on the simulated side of things. You could also say in a sense I’m taking simulated material and creating REAL world applications for it. I’m also designing a mentorship program that will help speed up the process on what people do and don’t need to know in order to get into Cyber Security, as well as get them ready for several certs all in one goal. This is long in development and won’t be available until another 4 or 5 years or so. It could be sooner depending on how things go. The goal of all of this is not to only be a form of revenue I can make by teaching and training up and coming Cyber Security professionals, but as a means to serve as a large scale portfolio that shows what I’m fully capable of. There’s also a sub category branch in here that’s going to feature some stuff that will focus on helping more women get into Cyber and tech overall as they’re mega underrepresented. </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Tool Development 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the things I’ll be focusing on in the long run will be tool development, ranging from a variety of custom software tools to aid penetration testers for exploitation development, as well as physical tools that can aid physical penetration testers.</p> <p></p> <p>In terms of the physical side of things, think of me as the more “gamified” version of what hack5 does. I’m modeling tools that are themed from some of my favorite video game series of all time while still being realistic enough to be applicable to the real world.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, one of my main ongoing projects is a custom penetration testing drone I’m working on that’s inspired from Watch Dogs 2.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Independent Contractor 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I haven’t spoken on this much until now, but one of the main end goals for me in the long run so I’m never in a situation where I’m out of work, is I want to become an independent contractor that provides penetration testing services and a variety of other things to people. You can find out more about the services I plan to provide on this page here for the company I’m currently partnered with to provide services through my brand.</p> <p></p> <p>It’s no shocker, but in today’s tech market ESPECIALLY for Cyber Security, you mustn't rely on an employer to give you a chance or keep you in Cyber. You need to do that yourself.</p> <p></p> <p>By having my own flow of contractor work, not only do I stay in the game and gain more experience, but I put myself in a situation where it presents more full time opportunities for me by networking me via contracts, BUT, I also am in a situation where I don’t have to rely on an employer to keep money in pocket. It’s a win win situation IF I play my cards right which I’ve been doing so far. It’s all a matter of perseverance and being patient.</p> <p></p> <p>I’m starting an official LLC soon so I’ll be able to provide said services on the book to people, as well as the many other services that have been talked about so far in my article.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Evil HERO Branch 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up!

Yes, of course. Absolutely they should provide this information to the public so they can look it over as well as various other auditors to verify if such information is true. Now I'm not talking about PRIVATE PRIVATE INFORMATION because that's a given no no, but overall when you design security products, or ANY product for that matter, you should wanna show the fruits of your labor.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I've been noticing a trend lately with Cyber Security firms, specifically new and upcoming ones trying to compete, where "tell" but don't "show". They'll claim they have the best detection system and that it outdoes many others, but when you ask them to SHOW you, they refuse to show you the results on a basic level. It's as if they simply want you to take you on their word and just buy the product, doing whatever it takes to prevent you from having some sort of sample or review of any kind, which is bad practice considering the fact it involves "Cyber Security", where 3rd party vendors have been known to ahem.... cause "breaches". You pick up what I'm putting down?</p> <p></p> <p>The laughable part? They take advantage of the fact most Cyber Security related services engagements are "Confidential" in order to get you to take their word for it. What do I mean by that? Ever been in an interview as someone's that worked in Cyber, but you couldn't really discuss what you specifically did there due to NDA's? Yeah that's what I mean by that.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Don't even get me started on how they exploit folks that don't understand much about Cyber in order to buy them into what they're selling.</p> <p></p> <p>The funny part about this is there are OBVIOUSLY ways to advertise what their products do and the overall results without breaching any form of NDA. How? I dunno???? Show us some test results and then actual feedback from places that ran said product?</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Leading By Example 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>What is a good example of what I mean by SHOWING? Wiz For example. Not only do they advertise a good product as well as other services, but they CONSTANTLY show you their overall competency through the intricate findings via their whitepaper security research they rep with pride. This can also be seen through the very employees that work there that show it off as well such as Stacey Lokey-Day for example. Not only does this generate interest in their products/services, but it opens a window of TRUST, where I can SEE the results.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>When you're confident in what you're selling, you'll never have issues showing people what your product is capable of.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I spoke good faith about him MANY times, even featured him in some of my past articles for people that wanted to break into Cyber, but he dropped the ball on this one.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>He had the potential to become one of the greats when it came to Cyber Security training and industry certs. Now I have to take back what I said and revise a lot of that stuff.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up!

You might even say that by the end of this article, you’ll also have an idea on HOW to properly read and analyze code altogether, which is an important skill set whether it be for Cyber, hacking, or areas like Software Engineering that MANY struggle with, more so since a lot of code typically is poorly documented, if any at all exits, which can be problematic for those that don’t know how to navigate the unknown without it. You shouldn’t have to of course, but in the wild, it’s what you’re going to see so it’s best to get good at it, more so if you're a security analyst and hacker overall. Threat actors aren't going detail how their stuff works. That's NONSENSE and would be silly!</p> <p></p> <p>* giggles while recalling my previous article *</p> <p></p> <p>It's not like Cyber Security professionals publicly do this on a daily basis right? RIGHT?</p> <p></p> <p>I’m going to explain how to analytically and strategically approach the unknown and figure out what makes it tick altogether, with a sample of some of the stuff I’m working on for my next series so you can easily follow along.</p> <p></p> <p>I’m also going to explain how to turn offense into defense which is something I’m really good at despite me NOT specializing in blue teaming.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Learn The Language 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>It’s a no brainer on this one…. But YES, LEARN…THE….LANGUAGE! Remember, you CAN reverse engineer and put two and two together, but you’re better off knowing the native language, otherwise you’ll not only have to research the language itself as you study it, but the code itself, on top of any unique techniques that might be embedded within the code. By simply being somewhat knowledgeable about the language first, from there, you can simply worry about studying the code for any vulnerabilities that might exist within it.</p> <p></p> <p>There are resources like W3 schools for example that can increase your level of literacy in a language depending on how experienced you are already with a programming language. For me this is about 12 hours per language to be prepped and ready in case I don't know the language.</p> <p></p> <p>Part of the main reason I know many programming languages is to avoid having to learn a new one. I'm literate in many already and can read and pick up as I go, which allows me to FOCUS on the analysis.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Break The System Apart 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the many benefits of studying code analysis, whether it be for vulnerability assessments or forensics malware analysis, is you get to “break” the system apart and see what makes it tick. This is where you get your hands dirty and REALLY get under the hood to properly understand how the system works.</p> <p></p> <p>Whether you be a threat actor or a professional who does things ethical offensively/defensively, This is a great opportunity to to learn, more so if you’re on the more offensive side of things, as you’ll not only be tasked with finding vulnerabilities and figuring out how to mitigate them, but threat modeling various attack vectors that are possible should a vulnerability exist within the code, meaning…. YOU GET HANDS ON EXPERIENCE CRAFTING EXPLOITS/SCENARIOS depending on which side you’re on which is the fun part. This also, of course, depends on the role you work for and overall responsibilities. This is also where you “learn” more complex programming techniques related to your area of choice in Cyber.</p> <p></p> <p>When you’re analyzing code, you want to get into the habit of breaking down each line of code at a time. Each line has a story to tell, and you might miss something if you overlook it no matter how simple it is.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, there was a set of JS code I was studying a while back for the new malware analysis series I’m working on. The code revolved around DOS’ing a server, but at a quick glance I assumed the way the code was behaving had much to do with overloading the web application server via HTTP requests only, HOWEVER, what I overlooked was memory overloads that were being used to crash the server. Each time the code ran, it behaved in a manner that would cause the server to store more and more memory which is unethical, which can lead to an eventual crash in the long run, more so since it is used for loops to enhance the process. For those that don’t know, using for loops consumes quite an amount of memory, and without proper memory deallocation techniques, with today’s modern processing power, you can crash a system in seconds.</p> <p></p> <p>By properly analyzing the code flow, I was able to both formulate a mitigation to the threat, as well as figuring out crafty ways to abuse the exploit.</p> <p></p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Document As You Go 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Many will love this, many will hate this, but DOCUMENT AS YOU GO! Each time you break the system apart, write comments next to each line. Get into the habit of that, as this will also teach you CLEAN programming habits in the overall long run.</p> <p></p> <p>It’s also a way for you to logically and algorithmically study the code flow, as well as leave “soft” bread crumbs that explain it to the next person that needs to read over your findings. This is also just, again, SMART practice! If you pull the comments apart, if you’ve been documenting everything properly, you’ll also already have a ton of documentation on the matter already, saving you time on writing the official documentation later on as you can simply extract from that.</p> <p></p> <p>How to properly document? Take a look at this quick sample of some of the code I’ve dissected for the first malware analysis I’m working on. THIS is what I mean by “breaking” the system apart, as well as documenting as you go. Each line is documented and thoroughly explained with my overall thought process, as well as being constructed with theories/hypotheses to further interpret the overall science behind the code.</p> </br></br> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/CodeSnippet1.png" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Exploit The Code 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Ever hear the saying “a good defense, makes a good offense”? Well… the same could be said in reverse ESPECIALLY when it comes to Cyber.</p> <p></p> <p>Regardless if you’re on defense, figuring out how to exploit something TELLS you HOW to defend something. I don’t specialize in blue teaming, BUT, because I’m exceptional when it comes to offense, I can figure out my defense from that.</p> <p></p> <p>I want you to go back to that snippet I made earlier. Remember how the comments focus on weaknesses I’m addressing in the code? You can take what you found and craft exploits with them. You can turn defense into offense, and offense into defense. You’ve just gotta be smart about HOW you go about it.</p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>- The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸</p> </br></br>`;

A lot of what I’m going to say in this article might be obvious to some, but rest assured, IT’S NOT OBVIOUS to MANY that work in Cyber. If it were, then I myself, as well as well established professionals wouldn’t be “winking” or hinting at this time and time and time again.</p> <p></p> <p>We have all the means and tools available, even the information which is publicly available and FREE, however, what if that were the very problem itself and WHY we have such BAD Cyber Security practices to date.</p> <p></p> <p>Keep reading and you’ll find out exactly what I mean by that.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Public Disclosures Hurt Us 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> Ever see the latest news on MAJOR security breaches or recent white papers from security researches that get publicly disclosed online? Yeah, THIS, although that information is nice, is part of the problem as to WHY threat actors are constantly able to adapt and stay two steps ahead of us. It also gives threat actors INGENIOUS ideas on how to piggyback off of recent breaches and evolve them, sharing that information with each other. Don’t even get me started on “living off the land” stuff that becomes possible when we “talk” too much. When you disclose PUBLICLY HOW certain breaches took place or how to prevent them on a technical level, you’re telling threat actors STEP BY STEP on HOW to breach your security systems. It's even worse since we have DEDICATED platforms that help fill threat actors on all this juicy information. A good example of what I mean by this, and this is no insult to anyone, would be the beloved Wiz. As much as I LOVE Wiz and a lot of other Security focused places that disclose Security research information to everyone, time and time again I’ve been able to get full in depth information on recent exploit techniques, where, if I were a threat actor, could allow me to devise said exploits against other infrastructures. Even without places like Wiz that do all of this, it’s still mandated by law that breach disclosure occurs. Now…. how to handle disclosures? Well… to be rather blunt…. Sum it up as quick as possible. No need for a diagram and all that. I know this sounds bizarre, but hear me out. It’s the job of SECURITY professionals to break down and study HOW a breach took place with just an overall summary and devise mechanisms of their own in order to defend against it, even apply needed patches if necessary for all systems. This of course would REQUIRE companies to have a DEDICATED budget for proper Cyber Security procedures which most still sleep on. Now, what do I mean by “summing it up as quickly as possible”? Ever seen a CVE that just dropped and you tried replicating it but have no idea how? THIS is what I mean by that. The CVE simply explains HOW the breach occurs without full in depth information on to the tee things, leaving it up to Security professionals to test and check against it on their own and figure out how to defend against it, OR, if you’re a threat actor, figure out how to replicate the exploit (which threat actors aren’t too keen on sharing how to do since they profit off of selling that information). </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Lack of Emphasis on Security 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now, this isn’t a shocker to most folks that work in Cyber Security, but security is almost NEVER in mind for most business infrastructures</p> <p></p> <p>🎃When developing complex systems and software</p> <p></p> <p>🎃Budgets</p> <p></p> <p>🎃Competent teams</p> <p></p> <p>🎃Incident response</p> <p></p> <p>🎃Security Audits</p> <p></p> <p>🎃Penetration tests</p> <p></p> <p>And the list goes on.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;"> Lack of Security Talent 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now this might rub a few the wrong way.. BUT…. WE DO HAVE SHORTAGE OF CYBER SECURITY TALENT. Not by numbers, NO, there is plenty of that. The PROBLEM is we don’t have the RIGHT talent in the RIGHT places. We have people that SHOULD be in Cyber, NOT in Cyber, and people that shouldn't in Cyber if that makes sense.</p> <p></p> <p>Cyber Security isn’t a game, there’s A LOT on the line should an infrastructure FAIL to prevent a breach: reputational value, financial assets, and of course overall jobs that are on the line that can be impacted should financial assets be impacted from security breaches. Not even just the company itself, but the very end user data hosted in them puts said individuals at risk which can lead to stuff like identity theft and a lot more.</p> <p></p> <p>A consistent trend, as disappointed as I am to say this… Is we have folks in Cyber that don’t “understand” security. Most of them know how to regurgitate what they “know” on Security related subject matters, maybe even use a good chunk of the tools to defend, even attack if possible (if they even, since most pentests are being automated now a days), but this doesn’t mean they “understand” security.</p> <p></p> <p>A lot of this is due to the movement of not having to be “technical” to work in Cyber or over prioritization on “soft skills” which leads to a lot of folks that aren’t technical enough to apply basic to advanced Security frameworks/procedures, all of which is more prevalent when dealing with leadership roles like CISO’s for example. This leads to MANY recurring situations where security breaches, basic ones that can EASILY be prevented.</p> <p></p> <p>How to find the right talent? We already have. The problem is Cyber Security has become a celebrity thing where only the cool kids get into the club. It’s become less about security and more about ego.</p> <p></p> <p>It’s also problematic that budgets simply don’t “exist” for said talent if that makes sense, rather, a refusal to make them.</p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it.

I’m going to list a few, using the ones I specialize in as an example.</p> <p></p> <p>Oftentimes when people are trying to learn the basics of Hacking and Offensive Security it can be a bit intimidating as it can be a bit “broad”, which is WHY it’s one of the hardest areas to get into, often requiring people to start with Blue teaming before they truly dive into it. I’m going to narrow it down so it’s not as intimidating as it appears to be.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Network Penetration Testing/Network Security 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This is a form of Penetration Testing I’m VERY proficient in as I stem from a background focused on networking.</p> <p></p> <p>Network Penetration Testing involves breaching various network infrastructures, whether it be physically via the main access point itself: Tapping into physical ports, Evil Twining/Jamming, etc, OR, digitally, where you’re coming from an external standpoint such as web application penetration testing, to RCE your way in.</p> <p></p> <p>The goal is to infect an internal network in order to uncover various nodes(systems) that exist on the network, formulating a daisy chain known as a botnet, where you, the botmaster, control all the bots on the network in order to monitor all activity on the network, as well as cipher and excavate any important data. You can even control the bots like “zombies” where you can command them, as trusted systems, to execute various tasks or tools on your behalf, allowing you to go undetected from various security systems either on the system or the network itself.</p> <p></p> <p>Creating a botnet is your bread and butter as a Network Penetration Tester and is your END goal in the long run.</p> <p></p> <p>Network Penetration testing is also a skill set that goes hand in hand with the next Hacking variation I’m going to discuss next, rather, you’ll become more proficient in it if you pick that one up first.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;"> Web Application Pentesting 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This is one of the more beginner friendly areas for Ethical Hacking and Offensive Security. It’s where I started, and is usually where the most essential skill sets for Hacking are picked up.</p> <p></p> <p>Web Application Penetration revolves around you hacking Web Applications which are basically websites in simpler terms.</p> <p></p> <p>In order to become proficient in it you need to have proper Networking fundamentals in order to understand how the internet works, which in the long run, should you master it, will carry over to internal network penetration testing which is where you can deal the most damage.</p> <p></p> <p>You’ll learn stuff like:</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Proper information gathering techniques</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Enumeration</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Injection Techniques which are HIGHLY common</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Client/Server Side Exploits</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Fuzzing/Filter Bypassing</p> <p></p> <p>And one other thing I’ll talk about next, which is a GOOD skill set to have. If you’ve been following my articles then this next topic will make a lot of sense to you straight away.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;"> API Penetration Testing 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I’m exceptionally good at this, as I often dissect various core API’s on a daily basis to craft unique exploits.</p> <p></p> <p>API hacking involves you exploiting the automotive capabilities of automation programs.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, a classic one, Windows32 API hacking, which involves you exploiting all the various core function calls of the Windows Operating System on a kernel level. The core API for it allows you to write programs that can communicate with the system in various ways.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, I can exploit functions that manipulate memory pages in order to formulate DLL injection exploits, allowing me to deliver malicious code alongside a particular program that loads on the system when the end user clicks on it.</p> <p></p> <p>Most Web Applications have core API’s that constantly have to be tested, otherwise you can exploit them and pivot into advanced RCE exploits that can deal some serious damage.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Mobile Penetration Testing 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This involves exploiting various mobile end devices in order to infect them, leading into stuff like SSH tunneling which can allow you to connect the device back to a remote private server you control in order to do as you please.</p> <p></p> <p>The best place to start to get a handle on it would be the Metasploit Framework. I have material on it video wise that teaches you how to do stuff like: extract contacts, tap into video camera feeds, enable a recorder to capture audio for the device, and a lot more.</p> <p></p> <p>Mobile Device Penetration Testing, should you get good at it, will further expand your overall understanding of IoT and networking fundamentals, as well as core OS skills, as it’ll push you a bit further in order to get crafty with pulling them off.</p> <p></p> <p>You’ll also become more proficient at botnetting as you have to do clever stuff like setting up apache HTTP servers that can deliver the payload to the end device accordingly.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, you can host an apache server, combining it with Network Penetration Testing techniques such as DNS poisoning in order to trick end users into downloading and executing the payload needed to infect the mobile device. You can then further combine obfuscation techniques in order to go undetected from the devices security systems.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>- The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸</p> </br></br>`;

It’s NOT an easy path, BUT, if you can get GOOD at it, then you’ll TRULY be able to learn on your own for FREE without anyone’s help!</p> <p></p> <p>I’m also going to address WHEN you would have to PAY in order to learn so you know how to properly spend your money should you need to do so. As much as I LOVE FREE learning, there are MANY cases where reasonable pay walls exist. NOT EVERYTHING IS FREE in life. I’ve had to learn this the hard way!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I make PAID content, but at the same time, I also want to encourage FREE learning as much as possible so people can LEARN how to THINK on their own and stand on their own power! It’s the main reason I write articles like this and give out as much advice as I can as possible and why I do what I do to give back to the Cyber Security community.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is FREE learning? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>FREE learning is just that, FREE! It requires ZERO money in order to learn. The only thing that IS required: is a computer, home internet, and the DISCIPLINE to learn on your OWN, emphasis on that last part! Technically you have to PAY in order to get these things, but I digress.</p> <p></p> <p>FREE learning is just another term for “Self-Taught”, which is common nowadays! A lot of people, when getting into Web Development was the new trend, were often commonly Self-Taught, myself included when I first started learning how to code. There were an ABUNDANCE of resources available online so it only made sense to teach yourself. Learning to code was no longer gatekeeped knowledge, so LITERALLY, ANYONE could learn how to code for FREE!</p> <p></p> <p>This is convenient for those that are unable to afford a FORMAL education from an institution with DIRECT guidance, where they can essentially learn all the SAME material on their own! This increases accessibility across the board!</p> <p></p> <p>HOWEVER, it did create one fatal drawback, which I’ll discuss later on over the course of this article.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Should FREE learning exist? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Anyone should be able to pick up a book or a computer and have the ability to learn on their own and at their own pace! It’s a human right!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How to Go About FREE Learning? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The best way to go about it is to get into the habit of filtering through information.</p> <p></p> <p>In case you haven’t noticed this about me by now… I AM GOOD at filtering through what I NEED to know Vs what I DO NOT need to know.</p> <p></p> <p>A lot of people struggle with this, even experienced professionals, but if you can get GOOD at this, then you’ll progress rather quickly.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The DrawBacks of FREE Learning? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I’ve talked about the BENEFITS of FREE learning, but now let’s dive into the DRAWBACKS of it!</p> <p></p> <p>For starters…. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN! You only have access to what you can find in order to learn, which there is PLENTY of!</p> <p></p> <p>“But Futaba if that’s the case, then why is that a DRAWBACK?!?! There are PLENTY of FREE material online for me to learn from so I-”</p> <p></p> <p>OBJECTION!!!</p> <p></p> <p>I think you haven’t been paying CLOSE attention to when I’ve stated “ON YOUR OWN”!” That’s right…. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN, as in SOLO, NO HELP from ANYONE! No one’s holding your hand so you LITERALLY have to sit down and FIGURE IT OUT on your OWN!</p> <p></p> <p>THIS!!! is the BIGGEST drawback to FREE learning, ESPECIALLY, when it involves Cyber Security which is HUGE in and of itself!!!!!!</p> <p></p> <p>When I first started learning about Cyber Security on my OWN, I had NO IDEA what I was doing or where I was going. NO ONE pointed out ANYTHING as to where I needed to go career wise. I had to sit down and figure it out! Even with ALL the FREE resources out there I was still running around with my head chopped off not knowing what the hell I was doing for YEARS!!</p> <p></p> <p>WHY? Well, let me elaborate with this next point!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Mentorship is NOT FREE! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Although FREE learning should exist, it does NOT mean however that FREE guidance should exist. You can’t have your cake and eat it too!</p> <p></p> <p>The price you pay for FREE learning is NO FREE MENTORSHIP or guidance.</p> <p></p> <p>“BUT THAT’S NOT FAIR THE KNOWLEDGE SHOULD BE FREE!”</p> <p></p> <p>Here’s the thing…. IT IS FREE!!! It’s EVERYWHERE!!! HOWEVER, what is NOT FREE, is expecting FREE labor AKA mentoring/tutoring from people. You have to be mindful, mentoring IS A FORM OF LABOR, labor which is NOT FREE. There are people out there that give back to the community which is nice, but you’re NOT entitled to it!</p> <p></p> <p>This might rub A LOT of people the WRONG way, but ask yourself this question, would YOU do it for FREE?</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">When Should You Have to Pay? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>It’s a no brainer on this one, but, like I’ve stated, when you’re looking for direct guidance from someone, OR, if you’re of course looking to acquire TOOLS/SOFTWARE to enhance your learning experience.</p> <p></p> <p>Also… as I’ve stated, there are MANY niche sources of knowledge, or QUALITY material, like from HackTheBox or TCM for example, where the only way to acquire it is through PAID methods. No one’s going to hand you what they purchased for FREE so don’t even think it works like that! I want their research content as well, but sadly, even I know in order for me to acquire it I would HAVE to pay for it.</p> <p></p> <p>Going back to the tools/software thing, yes, physical tools like the wifi-pineapple, AREN’T FREE. You have to PAY for them! Even things I’ve mentioned earlier: PC gear, internet, etc, all these things, in order for you to START learning for FREE, REQUIRE that you PAY for them FIRST!</p> <p></p> <p>Advanced IDS systems that you can use to build homelabs, oftentimes some of them are both hardware and software, which require you to PAY, hence most people can’t get hands-on experience with A LOT of this stuff unless they work for a company that has it.</p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>- The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸</p> </br></br>`;

The PROBLEM, like all things, is that people, REALLY intelligent people, lack the proper soft skills to explain it correctly to you.</p> <p></p> <p>Over the course of this article I’m going to use non-conventional and more fun ways to properly break down subnetting to you so it “clicks”.</p> <p></p> <p>It is ESSENTIAL that you UNDERSTAND subnetting as it also comes into play for offensive security when you have to navigate and find all the subnets that exist on a network to see where you can extend your attack surface. I am EXCEPTIONAL at this, as I not only have a full understanding of how subnetting and IP ranges work, BUT, I can “visualize” where I am, as well as make EFFECTIVE usage of basic commands that are commonly overlooked that TELL you how many subnets you have.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Subnetting? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Subnetting is the art of “splitting” a network into “subnetworks”, which is a network of networks.</p> <p></p> <p>Here’s a diagram in order to better visualize it.</p> </br></br> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/SubnettingForDummies.webp" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> <p>The top of the tree is the “core” network, the main AP that serves as the “exit node” or default gateway which is where all network traffic is routed to and from the network.</p> <p></p> <p>The sub trees that you see below are the “subnets”. Ignore the ones below the subnets for now as that’s a bit complicated like explaining recursion. The goal is to keep it simple so you can follow along!</p> <p></p> <p>Subnets have what is known as a “subnet mask”, the “/24” that you see commonly attached to a subnet IP address.</p> <p></p> <p>Ex: “192.168.1.1/24”</p> <p></p> <p>By default, this is the standard subnet mask that is usually assigned to you on a network.</p> <p></p> <p>If you apply subnetting you might see stuff like</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 “192.168.1.1/23”</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 “192.168.1.1/22”</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 “192.168.1.1/21”</p> <p></p> <p>And so forth. HOWEVER, be mindful THEY ARE NOT THE SAME SUBNET! The “subnet mask” is there to tell you which subnet a system belongs to on a network. Of course, many have differentiating IP addresses to tell the apart for simplicity's sake. It can vary.</p> <p></p> <p>You also have stuff like “IP Addresses Classes”, Class A, Class B, Class C, etc.</p> <p></p> <p>“OH MY GOD THAT’S SOOOO COMPLICATED” Nahh, not really haha. Classes define the “range pool” of IP addresses that you have available to dish out to systems on the network.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, IP Ranges that might look like</p> <p></p> <p>“192.168.1.0-255” indicate there is an available pool of 255 IP addresses, the final number being reserved for what is known as the “broadcast address” that is used to echo messages to all systems on the network should you choose to do so, and of course, the first one, which is reserved for the default gateway. You can of course configure these however you like, but it’s kept default for simplicity's sake.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How Does Subnetting Apply To Cyber Security? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The goal of subnetting is to obfuscate your defenses and avoid what is known as a “monolithic structure”, borrowed from the concept of containers which condense all dependencies for software into one “container”. For Software engineering, this is good practice. HOWEVER, for Cyber Security, this is BAD practice.</p> <p></p> <p>When you condense EVERYTHING into one place, you not only create, become a single point of failure, where should an attacker, such as myself, breach your internal network, EVERYTHING is compromised. Imagine I attack one system, and EVERYTHING goes down with it.</p> </br></br> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/SpecialistVsGeneralist.jpeg" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Synopsis 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p> Today’s article is going to focus on an interesting topic in tech, one that carries over to Cyber Security as well, Specialist VS Generalist. You’ve seen time and time again heated debates on whether or not one should be a specialist or a generalist regardless of what field they pursue in tech: Software Engineering, Cyber Security, IT, etc. I’m going to compare and contrast the two in order to fundamentally deduce which of the two is ultimately better, in my opinion that is. Feel free to disagree and leave your overall opinions in the comments section below. </p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What Is a Specialist? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Specialists are those that focus on ONE particular area in tech, the many skill sets that pertain to said area.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, you might have heard of the term of a “full stack” web developer where they have a certain stack they specialize in for the kind of web applications they specialize in developing</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 HTML</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 CSS</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 JavaScript</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Python (Django for example)</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 SQL</p> <p></p> <p>And the list goes on.</p> <p></p> <p>Another example, and this goes within the realm of those that specialize in offensive security such as penetration testing for example, would be the “types” of penetration testers that exist: network penetration testers, WAP penetration testing, API penetration testers, etc.</p> <p></p> <p>Typically, when it comes to Cyber Security, people often specialize in ONE particular area on the spectrum for whatever area it is they prefer, whether it be: blue teaming, red teaming, purple teaming, even people that specialize as a Gray Hat hacker such as myself for example.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Pros to Being a Specialist? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The obvious PRO to being a specialist is that you SPECIALIZE within that domain! You’re an expert at it!</p> <p></p> <p>Another MAJOR benefit, although this is a bit controversial, is you have “less” to learn/focus on. I know this one will TRIGGER many, but hear me out on this one.</p> <p></p> <p>When it comes down to a generalist vs a specialist, the BIGGEST difference is the overall learning curve and amount of stuff you NEED to know and keep up with. Generalists are BROAD and all over the place, meaning they have A LOT to keep up with, whereas, compared to specialists, they just have to stick to whatever stack or area’s/tool-sets they specialize in and that's it.</p> <p></p> <p>This is WHY, whenever people say offensive security is HARD to get into, which it is, it’s because of the aspect of having to be a generalist, where your skill sets need to be diverse, which can be difficult and time consuming to master. You’ve seen how BROAD my skill sets are right? It took me YEARS to learn and MASTER all that I know and I haven’t even scratched the surface yet. It’s the price you pay for being a generalist You can’t be good at EVERYTHING, HOWEVER, in trying to do so, you risk being overloaded with A LOT you need to know and be familiar/proficient with.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What Is a Generalist? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Generalists are people such as myself that tend to have a broad and diversified skill set.</p> <p></p> <p>Ever read up on some of my articles as well as my overall skillets and asked yourself “how the f**k does he know all this sh*t?” Yeah, that’s what I mean by being a specialist.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Pros to Being Versatile? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The BIGGEST pro to being a generalist is you have the right “tool” for every situation you might find yourself in, increasing your odds of success during many complex situations.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, during one of my CTF runs against some folks, part of the reason I was able to solve the “FindMe” challenge that’s also hosted on my custom CTF server, was because I had the following skill sets</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Reverse Engineering</p> <p></p> <p>🎃Malware analysis skills</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Code Review Skills</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Scripting Skills</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Forensics skills</p> <p></p> <p>And the list goes on.

This article is gonna be a short one and might also be of use to some folks in my network that might want to get into mentoring themselves, as it’s a solid way to hone your knowledge and skills, passing it onto the next person. I’ve been mentoring for roughly 5 years now, so I think it’s safe to say I have some solid experience under my belt.</p> <p></p> <p>but I‘ve never really clarified on HOW to be a GOOD one. Ever heard the phrase “There is no bad student, only bad teacher”? WELL… this is 99 percent true to a HIGH degree, more so coming from someone that’s autistic/neurodivergent.</p> <p></p> <p>Most people, even if they’re highly capable Cyber Security professionals or at whatever it is they do for a living, AREN’T fit to be teachers/mentors. You’ll understand what I mean by that as you continue reading the article.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Understanding the Student 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the biggest issues as to WHY most people aren’t good mentors/teachers is because they LACK the ability to understand their students. This is crucial when teaching someone as each individual learns in a UNIQUE manner, ESPECIALLY if they happen to be autistic/neurodivergent like me.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, due to my Visualspatial IQ, I’m a VISUAL learner, on top of being a low level and logical thinker. In order for me to properly understand what it is you’re teaching me, you NEED to provide a more visual example to me as well as explain it in FULL detail, which leads to my next point.</p> <p></p> <p>Fun fact before I move on, but did you know I FAILED out of all my programming courses when I was new to them simply because of this major issue? It wasn’t just me but 90 percent of the students in all my classes as well. It made me lose confidence in my ability to learn programming as well as pursue tech. When I started teaching myself how to code thanks to “The New Boston” who TAUGHT me how to code, I realized the issue wasn’t me, but the teachers I had, where his videos explained EVERYTHING in full detail. Stuff like while loops which went over my head, became easier and made sense, which allowed me to progress and realize, NO, I’M EXTREMELY GIFTED at programming. Even now I could code circles around most of my old professors whose classes I failed out of haha.</p> <p></p> <p>Fun fact, my teaching style stems from “The New Boston”.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">EXPLAIN IN FULL DETAIL! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now this might be MEGA OBVIOUS, but YES, PLEASE, FOR ALL THAT IS PURE, EXPLAIN EVERYTHING IN FULL DETAIL. I’M LOOKING AT YOU MATH TEACHERS!!!!! You’d be surprised how A LOT of complex subject matters aren’t as hard as we make them out to be.</p> <p></p> <p>One of the saddest realities of being really “smart” or really “good” at something is we “forget” that not everyone knows what we know. This can be problematic if you forget to explain all the little details of what it is you’re teaching. The only time you should EVER assume a student should know something is unless you’ve listed it as PRE-REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE BEFOREHAND, otherwise, you explain it in FULL detail.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, my articles. I’m not sure if you’ve noticed, but I explain EVERYTHING in FULL detail even if the reader might already KNOW what I’m talking about. This can be annoying to some, HOWEVER, I’m FULLY aware that not everyone knows what I know, so as such, I break it down in a manner where everyone can follow along, even highlighting some stuff that more advanced readers might have known.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>- The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸</p> </br></br>`;

Remember how I said I’d eventually cover OOP (Object Oriented Programming)?.... Well… THE TIME HAS FINALLY COME! Object oriented programming, as much as many folks (except for me shockingly haha) hate, IT’S A REQUIRED skill and knowledge set ESPECIALLY if you plan to be a Software engineer or read ANY form of code in general. I kid you not, NOT knowing OOP will lock you out of being able to read 99 percent of modern code today. It’s EVERYWHERE so it’s CRUCIAL you understand it.</p> <p></p> <p>For today’s article, instead of teaching it via conventional analogies and methods, I’m going to mix it up a bit and do it my own way. I’m also going to simplify and elaborate on stuff like Polymorphism as well. I’m going to stick to the more general stuff that’s seen in many languages that feature some form of OOP. I’ll even talk about stuff like methods which is Javascripts supposed “answer” or “version” of OOP in a sense (although they still feature it in C++ fashion shockingly).</p> <p></p> <p>Sit back, relax, and prepare to embrace how something is so complicated… CAN BE REALLY SO SIMPLE HAHA.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is OOP? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>OOP, which stands for Object Oriented Programming, is just basically a way to model custom functions that you can call and use around in your code. It simplifies the complexity and time consuming need to re-write complex programming algorithms from scratch, making your life easier. A perfect example of what I mean by that would be modules like with Python, were you can just “import’ or “include” something and you just call an “object” for it and you’re good to go.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, (DOWNLOAD THE IMAGE IF IT'S TOO SMALL FOR YOU)</p> </br></br> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/pythoncode.png" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> <p> Without OOP, you’d have to build ALL, and I mean ALL of this from scratch over and over and over again.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is OOP (Members)? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>You’ve probably seen me mention something about “members” that belong to a class, where you can “call them” and use any that are available to you. Members are basically the overall functions that make up classes and can even be made available to other classes that need them via “Polymorphism”, which is a fancy term for “inheritance”, which is where other classes you’ve written “inherit” functions belonging to other classes you have Think of it like “biology”, where you “inherit’ dominant and recessive traits stemming from your parents.</p> <p></p> <p>Here’s an example to put it better into perspective for you. I’m going with C++ on this one since it’s THE BEST example one can give on the matter</p> </br></br> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/cppcode1.png" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/cppcode2.png" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/cppcode3.png" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> <p>I hope this little light hearted lesson on what OOP is helped you out a ton.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>- The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸</p> </br></br>`;

Certifications Vs Experience, specifically, which of the two matter more, and which one will land you a job in Cyber. We go back and forth on the matter, but we never really sit down and “think” about the benefits and drawbacks of both, and whether not one or the other is better… OR both!</p> <p></p> <p>Over the course of this article I’m going to highlight the benefits and drawbacks of both, comparing the two in order to ultimately decide which one is better. Be mindful, this is just my overall opinion and you are free to disagree with me if you like. Also be mindful, a lot of what I’m going to talk about will also carry over to other areas of tech besides Cyber, so do pay close attention to all of what I’m about to say.</p> <p></p> <p>Also, like always, pay CLOSE attention to the way I “word” the overall article. You’ll get tripped up a lot if you don’t pay attention to the way I compare the two. In other words, PUT YOUR THINKING CAP ON!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What Are Certifications? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Certifications are the highlights of your knowledge on a particular domain within Cyber Security and contain the fundamental knowledge for you to pursue that particular area. They PROVE whether you have the sufficient knowledge to begin applying it.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, the CySA+ cert is the fundamental one for if you are pursuing a field in Cyber Security as a Cyber Security Analyst. It contains all the basic and advanced terminology you’ll see in the domain that you need to be familiar with, as well as knowledge on all the tools and frameworks you need to know before you get hands-on experience with it. Passing the exam indicates you are READY to apply to it!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Benefits of Certs? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Certifications serve you well in the long run, much like degrees (I know they’re hot garbage now haha), allowing you to meet the essential prerequisites for employers to even look at your resume when submitting a job application. Without them, you’ll be 10000 percent rejected on the fly as most AI/ATS systems filter you out simply for not having it.</p> <p></p> <p>You also become a PRIORITY over those that ONLY have experience, a common thing I’ve experienced myself when applying for jobs in Cyber, jobs I’m PLENTY qualified to do, which is the main reason I’m now going for them as well as my degree through WGU’s bachelors degree program.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Drawbacks Of Certs? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> They don’t necessarily mean you have the equivalent hands on experience nor do you understand the material on a fundamental level that is often required. They’re typically just multiple choice questions you answer looks at Comptia. They also cost A LOT OF MONEY and lock people that aren’t financially able to go for them like myself and many others. This is a HUGE problem, which is the main reason why they’re slowly chiseling out as a major priority for job requirements. </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Which Certs to Go For? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Go for certifications that are PERMANENT! Comptia ones are trash and require you to annually renew them each year, PER cert. Certs from HackTheBox - Dr. AITH as well as OffSec. Once you pass them you’ll never have to retake or re-certify them. That, and they are HIGH In demand and will actually land you a job cert alone!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Benefits Of Experience 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The overall benefits of experience, is that well… it’s EXPERIENCE, meaning you’ve not only learned the material, such as myself and many other self-taught folks, but have APPLIED the material, which is a HUGE problem with most cert holders today.</p> <p></p> <p>Experience can come in a variety of types: on the job experience, personal experience like projects and home labs, etc etc. How you get it, and the QUALITY of it, depend on how you go about it.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Drawbacks of ONLY Having Experience? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> As I’ve stated before, even if you have experience, if you don’t meet the degree/cert requirement, you’ll often be less favorable to employers. In their eyes, CERTS matter more and define your overall skill level… OR DO THEY!? </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Which is Better? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> Overall Experience is better and will CURB stomp ANYONE that is simply only holding a cert. I’ve talked about this before, but I’ve done a few CTF competitions with cert holders, and yeah… ahem…. A LOT OF THEM WERE STRAIGHT TRASH! Couldn’t run a few basic lines of Linux commands even if you had it set out in front of them. It’s a HUGE problem, and is the MAIN reason why the hiring process for Cyber is now favoring ACTUAL SKILLS vs having certs/degrees, the degree requirement soon to be a thing of the past. Overall, to maximize your effectiveness in the overall job market, try pursuing both, as it’s what I and a lot of other experienced professionals are already doing, which is now possible and affordable due to WGU’s Cyber Security degree program. If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it.

This article is going to be a bit on the 5 to 6 min read side so do be warned!</p> <p></p> <p>I’m also going to further elaborate on WHY I identify as a “Gray Hat” Hacker, something I’ve mentioned before but never really dived into much which plays a HUGE role in explaining the overall premise of this article. I’ll brush up on what a Gray Hat Hacker is so that anyone reading this can follow along smoothly, as well as leaving a link to the various Hat Archetypes that define each hacker and their overall purpose.</p> <p></p> <p>Most people when they’re looking to get into Hacking/Cyber Security their overall purpose is to either do it for fun or to pursue it as a professional career. Usually it’s a mixture of the two which is also part of the main reason I do it. HOWEVER, like I’ve stated in the main premise, there’s another hidden reason I do this, and why my skill sets are so broad for what they are.</p> <p></p> <p>I want you to pay CLOSE attention to the title of this article, as it’s symbolic and serves a purpose.</p> <p></p> <p>Fair warning before I begin, this article will contain SENSITIVE topics that might be faint for the heart, so feel free to click off this if this ain’t your cup of tea. I want to experiment with writing articles that address real world matters and how Hacking/Cyber Security applies to it, rather, what we can do as Hackers/Cyber Security professionals to address it.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a Gray Hat Hacker? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Gray Hat Hackers are a mixture of quality traits between White Hat Hackers, whom are good guys, and Black Hat Hackers, whom are bad guys, incorporating a series of ethical and unethical means in order to achieve their objective which tends to be more along the lines of “Hacktivism” for a greater cause or purpose. To put it into better perspective, they are GOOD guys that aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty, hence being in the gray area swaying either way. Their skill sets also tend to be a bit broad while having a certain niche.</p> <p></p> <p>A PERFECT example of one would be the infamous “Anonymous” group, where they target a lot of terrorist groups and corrupt organizations and expose them for the betterment of the world! They do whatever it takes to get the job done incorporating a wide variety of techniques, which allows them to achieve feats the ordinary Hacker/Cyber Security professional might have never thought were possible.</p> <p></p> <p>Be mindful, although Gray Hats aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty and will do ANYTHING to get the job done, they don’t usually resort to killing, as they tend to be more on the pacifist side, not ALL, but most in general.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Hunter Hunter 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I’ve talked about this before in my “The One Above All” article, but one of the main reasons why hackers do what they do is because THEY LOVE the THRILL of the hunt. What it is they like to hunt depends on the hacker which will greatly influence the skill sets they possess.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, CTF players that hack on a comptetional level, love the overall thrill of finding the exploit to secure the flag which tests the full limits of their capabilities. It’s exhilarating knowing you’ve pwned a system and have TOTAL control over it, as well as the many secrets it possesses. It’s even more exhilarating if you apply it on an unethical level and dabble in what you shouldn’t (I’m NOT encouraging you to do this!)</p> <p></p> <p>In this case, since we’re talking about Gray Hats, the thrill of the hunt for us is hunting whatever it is we’re most passionate about when it comes to activism.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Why I Became A Hacker? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The main reason I became a Hacker as well as a Cyber Security professional is to assist organizations that help track down and stop human trafficking operations, as well as anything along the lines of CSAM content distribution and a lot more. In other words….. I HUNT PREDATORS AND AM OBSESSED WITH DOING SO! If you would like to find out more about what CSAM is and why I fight against it check out one of my articles in the main catalog. I wrote it a while back to help raise awareness for how end to end encryption assists Child Predators online.</p> <p></p> <p>Although there are MANY things I would do to a predator if one were presented in front of me… I need a way to get my hands dirty while keeping it ethical! By working with organizations, even ghost ones for example that assist law enforcement, I can do just that, creating a world safer for women and children, most of which are the main target for these forms of operations.</p> <p></p> <p>There are also many other areas of activism I fancy such as hunt</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Hunting scammers (I’m looking at you JOB SCAMMERS)</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Hunting domestic violence perpetrators</p> <p></p> <p>and a lot more.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What Inspired me to Hunt Predators? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I’ve talked about this before, but my best friend was almost a victim of sexual assault and a lot more, where her step father abused her and put her in situations no little girl should have to go through, her mother being one of the many bystanders that allowed this to happen. There’s an inspirational I made you should check out if you wanna hear my view points on why we need to teach children how to protect themselves online. Link to it can be found in the advanced format for this article on both Desktop and mobile. </p> <p></p> <p>A lot of Child predators exist among us, most of which go unnoticed since their targets are usually those that are unable to defend themselves and or unable to tell when they’re being taken advantage of. There are also groups of people, usually on the dark net, that create content and distribute it amongst themselves as some sort of fetish party, often getting away with it due to various protocols such as the TOR onion one that assist in protecting their anonymity online.</p> <p></p> <p>By hunting predators and exposing their identities as well as how they are able to do what they do, I aim to help clean up the internet and help make it a safer place for Children online. All of this, of course, could also apply to what I’ve stated before about help fighting human traffic operations.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Evil HERO 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The Evil HERO is a side brand that I’ll be launching in the near future that focuses on partnering with organizations that help combat the things I’ve talked about in this article. It is symbolic for a HERO, or rather, an Anti-HERO that is willing to do whatever it takes in order to fight predatory activities.</p> <p></p> <p>I’ll be having side content that will strictly be there, focusing on news and updates regarding various predatory activities and what we can do to stop them.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>- The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸</p> </br></br>`;

They recently announced that from this moment forward, game developers are REQUIRED to disclose whether or not their game REQUIRES kernel level Anti-Cheat software. This is critical from both a competitive gaming standpoint, as well as a security standpoint.</p> <p></p> <p>This article was inspired by Stacey Lokey-Day who brought up the matter in her latest video that just dropped today! I’ll leave a comment for it in the comment section below!</p> <p></p> <p>The goal for today’s article is to explain WHY they now require game developers to disclose this information, as well as the overall dangers of allowing ANY form of software to have said level of access to your system. It’s not often talked about enough, but the level of access you give applications on your system can be something threat actors take advantage of to compromise a system.</p> <p></p> <p>I’m also going to dive into what a Kernel is so that you can easily follow along and UNDERSTAND why they’re now implementing this!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Kernel 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>You hear this term thrown around a lot, but not many really dive into the specifics of what a kernel is.</p> <p></p> <p>A Kernel is the overall biological makeup of an Operating System which dictates any and all hardware/software calls on the system, allowing them to communicate with one another.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, when you enter a keystroke on your keyboard, there are virtual key functions programmed on the lowest level of the system that read your input, the binary data, which is then converted to output, the text that you see on the screen. Keyboard injections for example, manipulate the Virtual keys of the system in order to have it execute tasks for rubber ducky exploits. Even stuff like: hitting the power button, pressing the eject button on the CD tray, EVERYTHING, is a part of the kernel and is a function call that belongs to the original programming of the OS system.</p> <p></p> <p>Another example, although this is not considered a kernel, would be an API, which is a program that is designed to automate a specific task: ChatGPT API, Windows API, etc. You can write code that controls the API, which if, depending on the API itself like the Windows one for example, would allow you to not only control the core functions of said software it was designed for, BUT, the kernel of the system itself!</p> <p></p> <p>Another way to think of a kernel would be all the function calls that exist in your program that you wrote which are callable at any time during execution of the program. Does that make sense?</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Kernel Level Access 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> Now that you know what kernel is, let’s dive into what Kernel access is and what it means when you give a program access to that level of privilege on your system. Kernel level access is just that, the highest level of privilege you can achieve on a system. Everything I just mentioned about kernels, when you give a program access to it, should threat actors compromise anything on your system that has that level of access, they can do whatever they want with your system. It can even allow seamless backdoor access for hackers if they wanted to install one on your system. </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What Does This Have to do with CrowdStrike? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>CrowdStrike was a PERFECT example of WHY you shouldn’t allow kernel level access, which is WHY Stacey brought it up in her video!</p> <p></p> <p>Because CrowdStrike allowed Kernel level access, any software failures that could have lead to registered hardware/software crashes which did happen, was plausible due to this level of access, causing a widespread of blue screens of deaths that LITERALLY shut down 8.5 millions of systems, DOSing many as well as causing issues with data mirroring that might have been in place and a lot more. For medical systems, if any of them were tied to life support, this would mean the death of many that were put on it.</p> <p></p> <p>The level of access you give an application to a system DOES matter and could be the very thing that causes a security breach!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>- The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸</p> </br></br>`;

I spoke before on “How to become a Hacker”, but never really elaborated on what defines a SKILLED one on a fundamental level! Be mindful, and I KNOW this might scratch a few heads, I AM ONLY TALKING ABOUT HACKERS! NOW CYBER SECURITY PROFESSIONALS! HOWEVER, you can take what you will from this and apply it to being a GOOD Cyber Security professional for example.</p> <p></p> <p>For the sake of this article, to prevent bickering, I’m going to focus neither on “tools” nor “manual” technical skills, focusing more on the overall aptitude of a hacker, skill sets and traits they overall possess.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Their IQ 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>You hear this term thrown around a lot: General IQ, Emotional IQ, even stuff like Visual Spatial IQ which is EXTREMELY rare and so happens to be the one that I possess, allowing me to solve EXTREMELY complex problems and visualize everything on a low level in my head BEFORE I solve it PHYSICALLY. But… What EXACTLY does one’s IQ mean definitively?</p> <p></p> <p>One’s IQ relates to how well one applies what they know, and of course, how quickly they can pick stuff up.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, let’s say I taught each one of you how to write a backdoor exploit in Python, THE EXACT SAME ONE, and then asked all of you to show me how you would pull off the exploit and how you would upgrade the code for it? The person that uses it better and applies it with more finesse is obviously the smarter hacker.</p> <p></p> <p>Part of being a good hacker is relying on your overall smarts and strategy to exploit systems or learn them.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">They’re Ingenious 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>VERY skilled hackers are ingenious! They’re always thinking outside of the box which allows them to stay several steps ahead of their adversary, maintaining the element of surprise, which is important when you’re trying to breach complex systems with security in place.</p> <p></p> <p>A good example of what I mean would be some of my insights on Hacking/Cyber related matters, where I explain the various flaws of a system and how they can be exploited on a fundamental level.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, my previous article where I talked about the dangers of the Claude AI that emulates keystrokes on a system to pretend it’s a real user.</p> <p></p> <p>On a basic level, you can write a simple keylogger with it… HOWEVER.. It’s possible to formulate metamorphic malware and a lot more if you got really crafty under the hood. All you need to do is get a bit more ingenious and you’ll go far as a hacker!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">They’re Ingenious 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Hackers are PERSISTENT! Part of the fun of hacking is the THRILL of the hunt!</p> <p></p> <p>As someone that has breached a lot of systems, It’s fun spending hours and hours, even weeks if need be to breach a system. Hackers love a challenge and love testing the capabilities of their intellectual capacity!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">They Understand Hacking is a SCIENCE! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>MANY folks don’t understand this… BUT HACKING IS A SCIENCE!</p> <p></p> <p>For example, the typical ping command, wouldn’t even think you could get much out of it right? WRONG! ICMP data packets return a value that is known as a TTL, which is the number of hops a data packet can take before it’s dropped! HOWEVER, under the hood, the return value for it is also another means to spot which OS archetype the end user is running which is a form of OS fingerprinting!. If you see a TTL value of 64, even without nmap, you can tell it’s running linux! This is useful on a fundamental level since A LOT of security systems block probes that come from nmap. You’d have to use your overall smarts and formulate a hypothesis based on that information such as: what are the most commonly used Linux OS’s(debian ubuntu for example). From there you can blindly probe and test exploits to see if any of them click. See how “ingenious” and 1000 IQ I got with that analogy? THIS IS HACKING!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">They Understand Social Engineering 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Social engineering is one of, if not, one of THE main skills EVERY hacker should know. It’s commonly used and when it connects… the damage that can be done…. DEVASTATING!</p> <p></p> <p>Being able to understand how your opponent thinks allows you to know their every move, which in return, allows you to craft a beautiful exploit. You can know what someone else will do before they even do it!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>- The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸</p> </br></br>`;

This is a BIG deal seeing as their reputation is on the line and they crippled 8.5 million systems around the globe, some of which were medical systems which is a BIG deal!</p> <p></p> <p>In other words, to better summarize this, they basically said “Nah bro it’s YOUR fault your systems went down!”</p> <p></p> <p>I spoke about the matter before and discussed why it’s actually considered a security incident, one of the biggest we’ve ever had, many of which thought the complete opposite.</p> <p></p> <p>I also dived into a sensitive topic regarding cloud based security and the overall dangers of it. If you would like to hear more about it, including a lot of my original points surrounding the CrowdStrike incident, check out this post here where I give my full insights on the matter.</p> <p></p> <p>The goal of today’s article is to discuss an important matter on WHEN it’s the end users fault or the vendor/providers fault during a security incident/breach. This is a HIGHLY debated matter that’s usually skewed all across the board!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Is it Delta’s Fault? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>NO! It is NOT their fault it took them so long to recover. Don’t let the gaslighting fool you, it’s CrowdStrikes fault!</p> <p></p> <p>Be mindful, the CrowdStrike incident CRASHED systems, and when I mean CRASH, I mean BLUE SCREEN of death crash, meaning the entire system was NON functional and needed a hard reboot! Every system that had incorporated their software was essentially taken off the map!</p> <p></p> <p>Crowdstrikes counter argument to them was partially because Delta Air Lines admitted to turning off automatic updates from them which they consider to be “lack of Cyber Security knowledge” on their end, which IS NOT bad Cyber Security practice! It’s good to do manual updates as you can filter out any bad updates should they occur! HOWEVER, be mindful, they did not refuse to apply major security updates where needed, so that argument from CrowdStike is a slap in the face to one of their victims!</p> <p></p> <p>Also, even with them turning auto updates off, they were STILL impacted during the major security incident! I want you to let that sink in a bit!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">When is it the End Users Fault? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Ever have stuff like MFA and various other security upgrades from apps shoved in your face? Ever had it forced on you otherwise you LITERALLY can’t use the app? It probably felt like a cold call from a salesman and you probably opted out of it just so you can go on with your day.</p> <p></p> <p>THAT my friend is WHEN it’s the end users fault!</p> <p></p> <p>It’s only the end users fault when they CHOOSE to NOT apply the security you set in place! CrowdStrike on the other hand, EVERYONE relied on it and CHOOSE to apply their security into their systems!</p> <p></p> <p>Another example of when it would be the end user's fault, is a penetration tester telling them what’s wrong with their systems and they CHOOSE to accept the risk rather than mitigate it!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">When is it the Vendors Fault? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>It’s only the vendor/providers fault when they FAIL to maintain the security for their systems set in place to protect end users.</p> <p></p> <p>A good example of this would of course be none other than CrowdStrike themselves, where EVERYONE applied the security but CrowdStrike FAILED to MAINTAIN the security!</p> <p></p> <p>Be mindful, CrowdStrike provides cloud based SECURITY to people…. so…. if they FAIL to maintain it… EVERYONE that relied on their service faced not only a security outage, but some… A SECURITY BREACH!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What Should CrowdStrike Do? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>COMPENSATE THEM OF COURSE!</p> <p></p> <p>It’s sad when the best of the best stoop so low and avoid accountability!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up!

This leads to you having to backtrack and find the EXACT resource you came across in order to solve a problem you’ve encountered before, OR, simply needing to recall a bit of information for trivia reasons if need be. This could cost you HOURS of time.</p> <p></p> <p>By documenting all your findings and research, should you ever run into this type of situation, you’ll have more quick access and be able to easily grep what you need. As long as you ORGANIZE everything, you’ll have no trouble finding what you need.</p> <p></p> <p>I’ve been documenting all my research and findings for over 12 YEARS in tech: videos, links, html pages of exact sources that have been redacted, EVERYTHING! I write my own research material and quick guides so in the event I don’t remember something accurately or I need to recall a technique, I can pull it up no worries, saving me the trouble of having to remember everything and dig for it again. In other words, I HAVE CHEAT SHEETS ON DECK!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">It Helps you Solve Problems 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Going back to that thing I mentioned before, it being able to help you with solving problems. YES, DOCUMENTING YOUR JOURNEY… DOES… HELP… YOU… SOLVE… PROBLEMS!!!!</p> <p></p> <p>Many times I’ve been in situations where I KNEW how to solve something, but FORGOT</p> <p></p> <p>HOW to solve it, specifically the thing I did in the past that worked. Usually for me the answer is ALWAYS on the tip of my tongue, OR, I’ll know the name of it along with partial information.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, when I was working on my Crypto Malware exploit, I FORGOT all about the Queue module but KNEW it was the KEY to helping me create the exploit! Because I documented my past code snippets on it, and it it was neatly organized, I was able to pull it up and borrow what I needed for it, further dissecting it, in order to craft the exploit, which I cut into a demo for people to learn from</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">You Pick Up Soft Skills 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>When you document your journey, oftentimes you’ll be FORCED to break it all down and simplify it so that you, the creator, is able to interpret/reinterpret said information when need be.</p> <p></p> <p>This is a GOOD habit to get into, as it allows you to get GOOD at explaining how well you understand the various tech and techniques you learn in Cyber.</p> <p></p> <p>Part of being a GOOD Cyber Security professional is being able to have solid soft skills. It allows you to better explain what you know to people that might not be all too technical, which could aid you in many areas: leadership roles should you pursue it, interviews with tech leads that want to see what you know, even content should you be interested in creating your own.</p> <p></p> <p>Part of the main reason why I’m so good at teaching complex topics in Cyber as well as breaking it down for you is due to me developing my soft skills.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it.

Programming isn’t as scary as people make it out to be.</p> <p></p> <p>To encourage you more, I’ll even address a sensitive topic on whether or not you need to be GOOD at MATH in order to code, a topic which most people that DON’T know how to code speak on a lot.</p> <p></p> <p>Be mindful, in terms of programming in general, THERE is no predefined order on which you learn first. It depends on the path you choose for what you intend to do. In my case I am speaking on HACKING/CYBER, NOT Software Engineering altogether!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Learn Python FIRST 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>It’s a no brainer…. but LEARN PYTHON FIRST! It’s a beginner friendly programming language that’s easy to learn and pick up, AND, you can do A LOT of crazy stuff with it!</p> <p></p> <p>You’ve seen my exploits and tools right? Nearly ALL of them are written in Python!</p> <p></p> <p>A LOT of people sh*t on python, but you know what they say, "ThEy HaTe Me CaUsE tHeY aIn'T mE 🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴"</p> <p></p> <p>Python is a multi-tool language that can do a variety of things: electrical engineering, GUI development, web development, machine learning, even low level stuff which it’s not designed to do.</p> <p></p> <p>It receives a TON of support, so much that you often question “what can’t python do?” It doesn't outdo EVERY programming language, BUT, it does do a bit of everything which is what makes it a hackers best friend.</p> <p></p> <p>Python is also a language that writes LESS and does MORE, which is one of the MAIN reasons it’s a hackers BEST FRIEND! A lot of my tools that I wrote would simply take TOO long to write in another language, whereas with Python, because it has such efficient and well written modules and frameworks for it, I can do something as simple as creating a backdoor in less than 20 lines of code.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Learn C++ 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I know MANY will disagree with me on this, but pick up C++. It REWARDS you MEGA hard in the long run, allowing you to pick up MANY programming languages and native fundamentals, as well as the native language it stems from which all syntax is based on which is C. You’ll be a coding monster in no time and will be able to speed blitz learning languages left and right!</p> <p></p> <p>“But Futaba C++ IS TOO HARD!”</p> <p></p> <p>NO, it’s not! MANY are just BAD teachers! You’d be surprised how simple the language is to learn if people just EXPLAINED it to you properly!</p> <p></p> <p>C++ gets a bad rep for being a HARD language due to OOP(Object Oriented Programming), which honestly isn’t hard either.</p> <p></p> <p>C++ allows you to do a lot of low level stuff, on top of allowing you to dive more into malware analysis and reverse engineering. You can also do robotics with it!</p> <p></p> <p>If you manage to get past the learning curve you’ll be unstoppable in the long run.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Is Math Required? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>drumroll plays</p> <p>NO! YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNOW HIGH LEVEL MATH IN ORDER TO CODE!!</p> <p></p> <p>Schools that lie to students dropping their drinks after me saying all of this</p> <p></p> <p>“HE’S A MENACE!!!!!!!”</p> <p></p> <p>YES ladies and gentlemen, people are LYING to you when they say you NEED to know advanced mathematics! I’ve been programming for over 12 years and not once have I ever needed advanced: algebra, geometry, calculus, etc in order to code. All you need to do is understand how programming works as a science and how to apply it in the real world. All the math is done for you. The most you’ll need is BASIC arithmetic!</p> <p></p> <p>There’s a reason why we have stuff like frameworks and SDKs(Software Developer Kits). It’s to make it easier for people to code, preventing you from having to build all of that stuff all over again.</p> <p></p> <p>The only time you’ll need high level mathematics is if you’re building your own encryption cipher from scratch, OR, if you happen to be doing anything that REQUIRES Math!</p> <p></p> <p>Colleges and Universities: “BUT THE CURRICULUM!!!!</p> <p></p> <p>SCREW THE CURRICULUM! I AM THE CURRICULUM!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it.

THEY DO NOT GUARANTEE YOU A JOB!</p> <p></p> <p>Most training programs like bootcamps and universities/colleges for example, sell on the fact they “guarantee you a job”, hence the testimonies they usually have in order to convince you to join their program.</p> <p></p> <p>The problem with most programs today, and why many are skeptical of them, reasonably so, is because they take your money and overall waste your time as most people have admitted they didn't’ land a role after completing said program.</p> <p></p> <p>Personally for me I’m ok with a training program NOT doing that. Just be upfront about it. Mine will be like that which I’ve made CRYSTAL CLEAR from the beginning!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Fix Part 2 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Training programs should be required to give sample courses/instruction that allow you to try their product BEFORE you buy into it! And by required, I mean as a LEGAL form of practice where there are rules and guidelines to follow should you operate said program.</p> <p></p> <p>At the very least, if it’s not something that can be legally done, it should be ethically done, where one should also follow in suit and NOT join anything that hasn’t given sampled course work to them.</p> <p></p> <p>A lot of programs are crafty and will expect up front payment first without ever giving you a taste of the product.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Do We Need them? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Combine recruitment agencies with training programs.</p> <p></p> <p>Has anyone ever thought of I dunno… having training programs that link you with recruitment that HIRES you?</p> <p></p> <p>Not only will this boost credibility for those looking to start genuine programs, but it’ll also allow people to jump right into the field should they graduate successfully from the program, GUARANTEEING them a job.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How To Pick one? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Like I’ve mentioned, make sure they give out FREE samples! If they refuse to do so, simply don’t invest in it.</p> <p></p> <p>Also, look for SOLID reviews on the program. If the odds are you can’t find any, OR, there aren’t any negative ones PERIOD, then that might be an indicator of a red flag for you.</p> <p></p> <p>Overall look for free stuff first and see your options BEFORE you buy!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up!

It’s also an easter egg that “probes” that part of your mind, making you more curious about my content. It’s also quirky and stands out a lot.</p> <p></p> <p>I also tend to drop a lot of easter eggs and references which also resonate with people since they LOVE finding their FAVORITE things that way.</p> <p></p> <p>My overall vibe? To make Hacking/Cyber Security GAMIFIED and MORE FUN! Tech can be boring, this coming from a tech nerd overall haha. The way I present the content to you, serving it this way, allows you to REMEMBER and RETAIN what you learn from my content, which is something most people DON’T do which I take advantage of!</p> <p></p> <p>One last theme for my content before I move on, is being as INSIGHTFUL as possible! My goal is to SHOW you how to think outside the box and inspire you to be creative with your thinking, which you NEED to survive in Cyber!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Build a Website 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A LOT OF PEOPLE neglect this, but creating a site of some sorts allows you to deliver your content in a more engaging manner.</p> <p></p> <p>Take my site for example. The vibrant colors, cards, and hover effects, even terminal mode, create an experience that leaves an impression on you and makes you want to click on stuff.</p> <p></p> <p>When building one, however you choose to do so, MAKE IT ORIGINAL, which is going to lead into my next point.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">BE ORIGINAL! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A LOT of people when they’re getting into content creation drop the ball by DOING THE SAME THING! That’s no good! You NEED to do BETTER! Evolve the standard formula and do something original with it!</p> <p></p> <p>Be authentic and unique! Having a personality matters, and will greatly attract people (if it’s good of course).</p> <p></p> <p>If you pay close attention to how I do things and run my brand, you’ll notice people are drawn to how authentic and quirky I am. It’s REFRESHING and strays from the same thing we’ve seen OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Find Inspiration! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the most common struggles with people that are looking to get into content creation is they have issues finding inspiration to CONSISTENTLY make content! I’ve struggled with this as well which is why I needed to take a break for a bit! I was running out of steam since I’ve already pumped out so much stuff.</p> <p></p> <p>Browse around other content creators and find stuff to talk about that is similar to the type of content you make! You can piggyback and talk about it, engaging with the OP, which further allows you to collab and work with other fellow content creators.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">COLLAB 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the most common struggles with people that are looking to get into content creation is they have issues finding inspiration to CONSISTENTLY make content!

I am a hacker after all haha. Let me give my thoughts on this new “AI” model.</p> <p></p> <p>You'll learn a lot of key stuff that could help you on your Cyber Security journey!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">It’s a THREAT 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>For starters, this thing is an overall threat in my opinion to be honest from a security standpoint.</p> <p></p> <p>Much like how hackers were able to exploit ChatGPT prompts to poison it, the same can be done for it, EXCEPT, ON A MORE DEEPER level if you get crafty enough with it. You can even mesh it with stuff like Windows Recall and other techniques to do some real damage with it if you wanted to!</p> <p></p> <p>“BUT FUTABA! IT’S ONLY IN BETA! THEY HAVE TIME TO FIX-”</p> <p></p> <p>OK! Yeah, So did ChatGPT and it’s other variants, but like ALWAYS, security is almost NEVER in mind for projects like this!</p> <p></p> <p>It’s more prone to security breaches than an actual person and further subject to compromise since it is unable to apply basic operational training procedures in a flexible manner to prevent exploits from connecting.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">It’s Rubber Ducky 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>However grins menacingly</p> <p></p> <p>It's also a rubber ducky that you can now seamlessly make and train for exploits since you can pool all the data from the API and seamlessly tailor it to whatever you need it to do. As someone that WRITES rubber duckies, this thing is a life saver haha. With the API you can even combine some analog stuff with it to give it a boost and have it do whatever you want.</p> <p></p> <p>It's even more scary since it could have access to higher levels of privileges you can easily exploit with it should you breach a system running this thing.</p> <p></p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Do We NEED This? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Tbh I don't see people really asking for this product. Seems like they're just trying to hop on the new bandwagon for AI products which is the new trend nowadays. It's not even AI tbh and is just a scripted engine that might require human interaction in the long run, making it non-autonomous which defeats the purpose of it being an AI.</p> <p></p> <p>This product, although it sounds nice on paper, has a major flaw in that it might not even be compatible and able to autonomously control various applications that exist in an infrastructure.</p> <p></p> <p>Much like with actual keyboard injection, it has to factor various versions and builds of OS and applications as well as the various infinite scenarios that exist while controlling the system. It's simply not possible to do all of that which will again defeat the purpose of it being an AI system since it will require you to know how to program said scenarios for how you intend to use it.</p> <p></p> <p>If they REALLY wanted to train it, they'd have to</p> <p></p> <p>FBI: “Go on I'm listening Tell me more 👀👀👀!”</p> <p></p> <p>AHEM.. as I was saying!</p> <p></p> <p>If they REALLY wanted to collect enough data in order to truly optimize this thing properly, they'd have to start collecting data on people's keystrokes and how they'd control the system which I DOUBT most people would be too comfortable with.</p> <p></p> <p>But hey, that's just a THEORY! A GAME THEORY- trap door opens before I can finish my line</p> <p></p> <p>Overall, I think they overall need to go back to the drawing board with this one.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>- The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸</p> </br></br>`;

I’ll also dive into a bit why I’m more drawn to helping them and WHY it matters to me so much.</p> <p></p> <p>I’m also going to give you a little history lesson on the major role Women play in tech and the major contributions they’ve made, many of which if it were not for them we wouldn’t have most of the stuff we see in front of us today, including technology that has even improved the lives of people like me with autism and various other forms of disabilities. We have A LOT to thank them for but it doesn’t get celebrated or talked about often except for special occasions like Women’s History month.</p> <p></p> <p>The goal of this post is to inspire women on WHY they belong in tech and WHY they should pursue a career in technology.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">They ARE the ORIGIN 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I’ve talked about this before… but WOMEN ARE THE TRUE FOUNDERS for anything related to computing technology.</p> <p></p> <p>Stuff like: The first human readable programming language such as COBOL which made programming more accessible to everyone, WI-FI which we all use today, Bluetooth, even the source code for the Apollo space project which brought us to the moon for the first time, were all created by women, most of which were NEVER properly credited to them. Even the first digitization of the “computer”, based on the analytical engine by Ada Lovelace, wouldn’t have been possible without them.</p> <p></p> <p>“But there are videos and history texts and-”</p> <p></p> <p>Yeah, but most of it is thrown under the rug without much coverage! Women were ROBBED of the spotlight they deserved, where the impression was given that MEN did it first.</p> <p></p> <p>They were known as “Refrigerator Ladies” where they were never really given credit for all the hard work they did.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">We Need More Women In Tech? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Ever seen a product so "unique" that you just knew you had to be apart of it!? This is where being authentic comes into play!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Personal brands are just that, PERSONAL! It's a reflection of your overall uniqueness and personal traits.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>WHY is this important? Here's a little analogy that I think you'll understand. Ever picked up a piece of "music" and you "felt" like it "spoke out to you"? Being authentic allows you to connect with others who share the same perspective as you!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>For example, part of my brand is a whole "gamified" Cyber Security vibe! This allows me to connect with folks in the Cyber realm, A LOT of which recognize a lot of the iconic themes and references I drop all the time. This allows me to build a relationship and network with them, establishing what is known as "reputational" value that plays a big factor into whether they wish to support my content!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Even the way I write my articles is authentic, in that I'm very "insightful", dinging the light bulb in folks head that gets them thinking!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Purpose Of My Brand? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I don't really talk about this much, mostly because I don’t like making promises I can’t deliver on, but one of the main focuses for my brand in the long run will be to partner and get sponsored by places like WiCyS that help women pursue careers in Cybersecurity and technology. Part of my program, the main reason it’s taking a bit to polish it is because there WILL be a section for WOMEN in it where they get a lot more attention to make sure they’re fit to pursue whichever path in Cyber they see fit.</p> <p></p> <p>I also want to show up to more conferences and teach them. It’s fun!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>- The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸</p> </br></br>`;
