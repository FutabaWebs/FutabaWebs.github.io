As always, this will be for paid patreon members only. </p> <p></p> <p>For this article, we are ONLY going to talk about some of the basic ones you should know first: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE</p> <p></p> <p>Any other ones mentioned later on will be for paid patreon members only.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "http" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What are HTTP methods? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>HTTP methods are a series of request types that tell the backend of the server to perform a said action, and then interact with the client in a certain way. How each one works varies depending on the one that you are using.</p> <p></p> <p>The default HTTP methods that we are going to cover today are.</p> <p></p> <p>🎃GET</p> <p>🎃HEAD</p> <p>🎃POST</p> <p>🎃PUT</p> <p>🎃DELETE</p> <p>🎃CONNECT</p> <p>🎃OPTIONS</p> <p>🎃TRACE</p> <p>🎃PATCH</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "get" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the GET HTTP request? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The GET HTTP method, the default one that is commonly used in any and all HTTP servers, is used in order to fetch data from resources on the HTTP file system. </p> <p></p> <p>For example, when you enter “https:// google [.] com”, your web browser will send over a GET request to the HTTP server in order to load the page you want to view.</p> <p></p> <p>It can also be used to fetch stuff like executables or files that are on the HTTP server that you wish to also download. </p> <p></p> <p>It’s also common for input parameter fields, like searching a website for products on the page you wish to purchase. When you enter in the name of an item you want to purchase, a GET request is made to the backend of the server, in which it will perform a database query that will retrieve the elements form the database, placing it in the given fields where the main web application wishes to present them to you.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, when you search “cats”, in lets say a website for example, the main HTTP GET request, as well as the name of the item you are searching for is processed by the backend that will allow GET requests, parsing it, and piping in a request like so</p> <p></p> <p>“SELECT makeup FROM makeuptable WHERE Product_ID=”YOUR_INPUT”. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "post" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the POST HTTP request? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The POST HTTP method is commonly used in scenarios where the HTTP server needs to handle user input data and submit it, like login data for example, or any kind of data that needs to be processed by the backend in order to perform a specific action. The backend handles said data, and then processes it to the system for a variety of purposes: resources directly on the file system, database queries, etc. </p> <p></p> <p>It can also be used to upload stuff like files for remote file inclusion for example. </p> <p></p> <p>It can also be used for simple retrieval purposes if needed to, but the main purpose of the request is to do what I just mentioned.</p> <p></p> <p>Threat actors commonly exploit the POST HTTP method in order to perform a variety of server side attacks, since, depending on how the backend of the HTTP server is configured to handle the processed data, they can manipulate the system in a variety of unique ways: SQL injection, Command injection, Cross Site Scripting, etc. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "put" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the PUT HTTP request? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The PUT HTTP method is used in order to modify and update resources that are already on the HTTP server file system. </p> <p></p> <p>It can also be used, depending on how the PUT request method is programmed for the backend, be used to add an entirely new resource to the system itself. </p> <p></p> <p>I say this strongly because, one of the obvious things to do as a security professional would be to ONLY allow it to update resources which is what it’s designed to do.</p> <p></p> <p>If a threat actor finds a way to pull this HTTP method off, they can basically remotely include as many files as they want to the server and exploit the system in a variety of ways. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "delete" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the POST HTTP request? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The DELETE HTTP method is the opposite of the PUT HTTP request method, where instead of adding or updating files/resources on the main file system, it instead REMOVES them from the file system. </p> <p></p> <p>For this one, since it’s obvious, you can wrap your head around what’ll happen if an attacker is able to pull this off.</p> <p></p> <p>This can be CRUCIAL for stuff like modifications to an end user account, when you change stuff like your username for example, as well as various aspects of information that need SPECIFIC ways of being updated on the HTTP server file system, that might or might not have to do with the end user specifically. </p> <p></p> <p>It sounds a bit complicated, but try to process the example I’ve just mentioned</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/HTTPRequestsMethods" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

It’s one of the biggest reasons in the event of a real situation where there is a threat to the safety of others concerning certain forms of data, business infrastructures refuse to disclose it unless there is a certain process they undergo to safely do so. </p> <p></p> <p>This article is a part of the Danger! Series, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advanced version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "csam" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is CSAM? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>CSAM is “Child Sexual Abuse Material '', which is any form of sexually explicit inappropriate content regarding adolescents and kids overall. Think (DON’T ACTUALLY THINK!!) of it like “porn” but for pedophiles. It can be collected and fabricated in various ways. </p> <p></p> <p>This form of content is HIGHLY illegal, where often times it’s fabrication results in the sexual assault and abuse of actual children to make it. There are even human trafficking operations where children are explicitly kidnapped for these purposes on top of other things. </p> <p></p> <p>Due to its nature, a lot of underground activity for it occurs on the dark net in order to serve it to its ahem… “high” following fanbase. </p> <p></p> <p>There have also been other means to fabricate it such as A.I for example, which can turn pictures of children into sexually inappropriate content, or even create said content out of whatever data is available to them even if it doesn't involve actual pictures of children. </p> <p></p> <p>CSAM has also gotten to the point where Kids are being harassed and extored online into sending this type of content to predators, which has lead to the deaths of many via suicide.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "e2e" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is End to End (E2E) Encryption? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the main topics for today is to talk about the dangers of E2E encryption, and how it’s being used by companies to “turn a blind eye” to CSAM cases. </p> <p></p> <p>This form of encryption, although it sounds good on paper, has LOTS of fatal flaws depending on WHERE and HOW it’s used. In the event of something basic like PGP for emails or a PKI system, where public and private crypto keys are being used to exchange data for business infrastructures, this is harmless. There are also means to strip the network traffic should it be necessary for security within the infrastructure.</p> <p></p> <p>In the event of how certain social media platforms implement it: Meta, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc. it can be a deadly tool to allow platforms that CHILDREN operate on to be vulnerable to sex extortion cases and can be a means for servicing CSAM material.</p> <p></p> <p>End to End encryption's biggest enabler for CSAM, is that NO THIRD PARTIES are able to intercept and view ANY of the traffic that is being sent between various main parties, including THE COMPANY THEMSELVES.</p> </br> </br></br> <h4 id = "social" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">E2E allows social media platforms to turn a blind eye to CSAM! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Ever noticed what the ruckus was when platforms like meta implemented end to end data encryption? </p> <p></p> <p>It’s not due to the fact it’s being used to secure end user text messages and data, which would be a good thing if only the case. </p> <p></p> <p>The PROBLEM is these types of platforms cater to both adults and CHILDREN! They can coexist and interact with each other at the same time. Even with stuff like messenger for kids, it’s still possible to make a dummy account and interact with children.</p> <p></p> <p>With end to end encryption, pedophiles and other forms of cyber criminal activity can go left unnoticed, or to better phrase it, “indecipherable’</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DangerE2E" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

It’s an abundance of FREE knowledge, one that if you know how to use it, you’ll become one of the most skilled and dangerous hackers of all time. Think of the Metasploit as all your “past lives”. You have access to all of that information. You just need to learn how to use it properly. </p> <p></p> <p>This article will of course be video oriented, and will only be available to PAID patreon members only. </p> <p></p> <p>It’s no shocker that it’s a staple tool in every hacker’s tool belt, but shockingly enough, due to how times have changed, I don’t quite see it picked up by newcomers or talked about enough anymore. I know it still sees light and people use it, but nowadays I rarely hear anyone post or even talk about it, and it’s one of the standard tools much like aircrack-ng. People forget that a lot of newer tools are based on the original ones that are known and loved by the hacker community.</p> <p></p> <p>Recently one of my favorite authors ran into an issue where someone thought recommending Aircrack-NG was a horrible idea due to how old it is, when it is in face one of THE best pentesting tools hands down to seamlessly crack various wireless encryption: WEP, WPA, WPA2, etc. Even most pentesting methodologies or tools mimic it in some shape or format just like with metasploit.</p> <h4 id = "metasploit">What is Metasploit? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Metasploit is an offensive security penetration testing framework that can be used for a variety of penetration testing methodologies: web application, networking, C&C/botneting, mobile hacking, etc. It’s a multi-tool power house in case you haven’t noticed, and has left a legacy, where tools like SET, routersploit and even kali nethunter mimic in terms of overall terminal functional and design. It also has one of the best well maintained database archives of any and all exploits that exist in its database. The code written and stored in it is beyond our deserving.</p> <p></p> <p>Metasploit is also both an easy to use tool for beginners as well as a complex tool for more advanced folks in the hacking community, one that can require a bit of skill to use effectively. It’s also one of THE most maintained tools that you could ever pick up, as most tools, even if they’re super good and practical, lack support and maintenance, EVEN, if they happen to surpass it overall in functionality. It helps even more as most of the stuff is already there so no need to reinvent the wheel, just build on top of it, which many have like I’ve said before. </p> <p></p> <p>I’m going to talk about some of the opinions that you’ll see in the framework and what they mean as it can be quite confusing. </p> <h4 id = "aux">Auxiliary Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>If you’ve noticed in my hacking with Shodan exploit guide, you’ll notice that when I use the shodan module, in the module address in the metasploit framework, the first part of the address begins with “auxiliary”, which indicates that that the module you are using is a form of information gathering tool. </p> <p></p> <p>You can use various auxiliary tools in metasploit for various purposes: port scanning, OSNIT, etc. </p> </br> <h4 id = "exploit">Exploit Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the most commonly well known module formats in metasploit, the exploit module, is basically an auto pwn exploit, where you simply need to pass in the coordinates, or configuration: IP, port, any word lists depending on the module, etc, and the tool set will do ti’s thing.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, for setting up reverse TCP shells, you have the classic exploit/multi-handler module which allows you to set up a multi purpose server that can be set to work with: linux, mac, and windows payloads, and auto pwn the system should you get the executable up and running on it. </p> </br> <h4 id = "payloads">Payloads 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Payloads are an interesting feature, as MANY don’t quite understand how to use them properly.</p> <p></p> <p>Payloads are basically the malicious code or executable that you’d often have to use mfvenom for in order to generate them, along with setting them inside exploit modules like with hacking mobile devices to get them up and running. </p> <p></p> <p>They are standalone and need to be delivered to the target in order for them to work. How you go about that is all up to you. </p> <p></p> <p> Next, I’m also going to also go over some other stuff you ONLY do with the msfvenom feature that is a part of the metasploit framework: encoders, evasion, etc.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/metasploit" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

Of course whistles I’m just theorizing. It’s not like I’ve been paid to do this stuff before right haha…. cricket noises.. AHEM… back to the point of the matter!</p> <p></p> <p>I’m also going to talk about what SPOF is since it’s a CRITICAL topic that you’ll often come across in Cyber and Information security, WHICH YOU NEED TO KNOW. It’s so important that simply not knowing it is one of the MAIN reasons why we have so many security breaches and bad Cyber Security practices. </p> <p></p> <p>Lastly, since this is of course the danger series, I am going to address MANY remedies that can be done in order to enhance your overall network security, most of which you probably have never thought of in the first place. I’ve played around with a lot of this stuff, so do take my word for it. </p> <p></p> <p>This article is a part of the Danger! Series, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "wap" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a WAP? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>WAP, which stands for wireless access points, are the various gateway networking devices that we use to access various local networks including the internet: routers, hubs, switches, etc. They host various endpoint devices: laptops, desktops, mobile devices, CCTV systems, that are able to communicate with each other on the network via various networking protocols like TCP/IP for example, allowing them to exchange various data packets in order to communicate. Think of WAP’s, in the case of this article, like your “house”, where you are trying to “protect” it. You still following me? Good!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "spof" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is SPOF 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>SPOF, which stands for Single Point of Failure is when one endpoint or vulnerability leads to a SIGNIFICANT compromise of a multitude of systems in an infrastructure(s). </p> <p></p> <p>For example, the common element of a human factor via phishing and social engineering. It doesn't matter how many security factors you have at play, if even ONE person screws up and lets the threat actor in, then it is all for naught, hence it is a SPOF.</p> <p></p> <p>Let’s try another factor, but this time a bit more technical. Let’s say you happen to have multiple endpoints with application systems on them facing each other, many of which have access to each other's resources, even the most critical ones. In the event should ONE of these systems, or even if it were a singular system that was connected to everything in the same manner, it would lead to a MASSIVE SPOF that could do some heavy damage to the infrastructure. </p> <p></p> <p>Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, let’s dive into the main dangers that could happen should a your WAP happen to be compromised. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "hackers" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Your WAP aid’s hackers 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Anonymity is one of the biggest assets for a threat actor. It allows them to go undetected and remain untraced. There are NUMEROUS ways to go about this: burner phones, burner laptops, tor, FREE wifi spots, etc, BUT, did you know that YOUR AP(Access Point) can be used as a means to allow threat actors to keep their anonymity. </p> <p></p> <p>Now this doesn’t sound too bad right? Someone wants to use your wifi without your consent, not a big deal! WRONG! It becomes a HUGE deal when what they are doing is being traced back to YOUR location and IP address. Even if you are innocent, if the odds are law enforcement tracks back malicious activity to your IP address you suddenly are thrown under the bus by something you didn’t do. </p> <p></p> <p>Everything I’m saying is a COMMON tactic that hackers use to stay off the radar. If you use someone elses WIFI, it even let’s you do the one thing threat actors should NEVER do, which is hack from the comfort of your own home.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DangerWAP" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

BUT, don’t be misled by what you see on paper. Not everything translates well. </p> <p></p> <p>The main overall goal of A.I., which stands for “Artificial intelligence”, as I’ve mentioned, is to serves to overall be a replication of human intelligence. That’s the goal of computing technology overall, as we’ve quite LITERALLY tricked an actual rock into THINKING… AND IT WORKED. Computing technology is supposed to be an extension as well as amplification of the human intellect and capabilities. So far we have computers that are able to follow instructions and perform tasks with 100 percent accuracy and proficiency at incomprehensible speeds…. just as long as it’s been programmed to do so CORRECTLY of course. The big downside of this, as impressive as this might all sound….. Is it’s NOT actual HUMAN intelligence. It is just an imitation of it. The problem with A.I. is we’ve falsely assumed we’ve surpassed human intelligence when we couldn’t be further from the truth. We haven’t even replicated it, yet we seem to think we’ve reached a new era of utopia where it’s far surpassed us. We’ve still got a long way to go. </p> <p></p> <p>I’m also going to talk about why I don’t like A.I., which is mostly due to the FALSE image that it has implanted in our minds and WHY I’m enjoying it’s slow and inevitable downfall. I’m a HUGE tech enthusiast, and am VERY open minded to many implementations of it. Tech has advanced society to limits that I wouldn’t have imagine possible, which also lead to it HELPING a lot of people overall, as well as made things more accessible for the disabled: prosthetics, eye care, hearing impaired, etc, the list goes on. Typically technology BENEFITS EVERYONE and has a POSITIVE effect (ahem… I know what you’re thinking just go with it haha), but in the case of A.I, it has lead to the false impression of a utopia that simply WILL NEVER EXIST! One where the robots will do all the work for us so we can just sit back and relax and prosper from it. We looked only at the short term of A.I. and not the long term, and because of that, we are PAYING a hefty price for it. It’s being used to REPLACE us, NOT HELP US. </p> <p></p> <p>Lastly, I’ll also be covering a few HUGE security risks and COPY right laws that come into factor regarding it. </p> <p></p> <p>This article is a part of the Danger! Series, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent.

Think of it like raising a child, and slowly educating it over the years. The human brain has the learning capacity to retain experiences far and wise no matter how much time has passed, which is what we are trying to simulate. This is also what is commonly known as Machine Learning. One of the most commonly used programming languages for data structures is poses and brags PYTHON.</p> <p></p> <p>There is a HUGE flaw to this and I’ll discuss it shortly.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "jobs" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How A.I. has impacted the Job Market? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>As you might have noticed over the past 2 years so far, roles in tech, especially with software dev and Cyber, which pay the most, have taken a HUGE dive and have been experiencing MASSIVE layoffs and reduction in overall workforce size for various infrastructures. There are many financial factors that lead to this, but one of the most influential ones that I am going to discuss today has to do with the introduction of A.I.</p> <p></p> <p>A.I. has introduced the concept of automated work, which is a form of utopia that many have been craving for for a while now, essentially computers and other forms of machinery doing all the leg work for us while we just sit back and relax. In a perfect world, this would be wonderful. HOWEVER… the world doesn’t work like that.</p> <p></p> <p>What has been happening is businesses have been incorporating A.I. to essentially replace staff members due to the impression that A.I. can now do all of the work for us. This is due to a topic which I’ll discuss next.</p> <p></p> <p>This has overall left many out of work and in fear of being replaced by A.I. which so far has been the case, but is slowly coming to a standstill due to the obvious reasons, which I’ll dive more into next.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DANGER_AI" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

This is taking inspiration from reveshells which have a series of RCE shells that you can download and interact with that will allow you to seamlessly achieve RCE for any remote file upload exploit. </br> </br> Why am I covering this despite there being a site that allows you to do so? Well, much like all things involving hacking you’ll run into situations where you need to write more complex code, even code that is pre-made beforehand for an exploit which might go out of the scope of what you need said program to do. This is also due to the fact that various detection systems are able to identify signature patterns. If you know how to write your own code you can apply further obfuscation methods that will allow you to bypass security. </br> </br> I am also going to show you how the code works under the hood so that you have a CLEAR understanding of how it works and how to write it yourself. </br> </br> This WILL be in the lab upcoming, so I recommend you get good with this as the REAL exploit for the next lab is going to be a lot more complex. </br> </br> Disclaimer </br> </br> As always, personal disclaimer, any and all information for this is strictly for educational purposes and I do not condone any form of illegal activity, nor am I responsible for anything you should use this information for.

What I’m going to show you today is the overall premise and concept behind the technique. This is the DEFINITIVE example and BEST way to EASILY explain how binary injection works to ANYONE that wants to learn more about it. </p> <p></p> <p>Binary is overall one of the HARDEST techniques to learn and master mostly due to there being FEW GOOD resources that can teach it to you. </p> <p></p> <p>I’m also going to write some sample code in C that will be vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks, so that you can play with it and get a feel for how it works on a technical level. This will also set us up for the next part, which will be me covering how to use a debugger to analyze the code flow, as well as perform the overall exploit the manual way. There are more special surprises for binary injection coming up so do stay tuned. </p> <p></p> <p>As always, any and all videos that are included with this article will be for PAID members only! You can check out my tiers and pricing down in my patreon link in the comment section below as well as on my website. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "binary" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Binary injection? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>There are situations where web application servers will have a program with a service running binded to a port. When you connect to it, the program will run. In some cases, you’ll run into a situation where the program will ask you for user input, which is a common thing. You can fuzz it like how I showed you in previous examples to trigger a segmentation fault which can result in you landing RCE against the server side application, potentially a lot more if you can secure the source code for the application.</p> <p></p> <p>To give you a better example of what I mean, run the following command nc canyouhack.us 1985. </p> <p></p> <p>THIS IS A CHALLENGE IS FROM “SECURITY INNOVATION” THAT HOSTS THE <a href = "http://canyouhack.us/" style = "text-decoration: none;">“CANYOUHACK.US”</a> CHALLENGE WHICH HOSTS A BINARY EXPLOITATION SERVER LEGAL FOR TESTING.

This was to highlight the dangers of leaving vulnerable code within an application and how it can be exploited by threat actors to execute it which can be problematic if you’ve left stuff like backdoors in the code that the threat actor can easily piggyback off of to compromise internal infrastructures. </p> <p></p> <p>This time around, we are going to take it a step further and exploit the overall application to have it perform ANY form of RCE that we want against a target application whether it be in plain text format or binary format. </p> <p></p> <p>This is a CRUCIAL skill to master, as you’ll often run into various CTF challenges that require you to know binary exploitation, as well as overall in general if you are running some security tests. It overall comes in handy if you’re just a hacker in general and is a STAPLE skill to master. You’ll go a long way, ESPECIALLY if you plan to do forensic with this skill set. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "rce" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Why is RCE with Buffer Overflow Important? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>There are situations where web application servers will have a program with a service running binded to a port. When you connect to it, the program will run. In some cases, you’ll run into a situation where the program will ask you for user input, which is a common thing. You can fuzz it like how I showed you in previous examples to trigger a segmentation fault which can result in you landing RCE against the server side application, potentially a lot more if you can secure the source code for the application.</p> <p></p> <p>To give you a better example of what I mean, run the following command nc canyouhack.us 1985. </p> <p></p> <p>THIS IS A CHALLENGE IS FROM “SECURITY INNOVATION” THAT HOSTS THE <a href = "http://canyouhack.us/" style = "text-decoration: none;">“CANYOUHACK.US”</a> CHALLENGE WHICH HOSTS A BINARY EXPLOITATION SERVER LEGAL FOR TESTING.

You have to pipe it over the nc command which you can do with certain tools of course.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "gdb" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the GDB Debugger? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This is one of the most commonly used tools for binary exploitation, whether the code is in direct plain text format, or binary format such as an executable like a .exe file that you commonly see on windows. When you try to open one of those, should you try to do so, you’ll notice all the code is garbled and is in what is known as binary format. </p> <p></p> <p>Using a debugger you can analyze all the code flow and function calls on a lower lever, in some cases, being able to retrieve the code itself (minus comments as those are removed when the program is compiled), allowing you to find weak points in order to exploit the program. </p> <p></p> <p>I’ll be covering some of the basic commands and options, as well as explain what they do. </p> <p></p> <p>I RECOMMEND THAT YOU LEARN MORE ABOUT “STACKS” AND “REGISTERS” VIA ASSEMBLY, AS THIS WILL ALLOW YOU TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT ON A LOWER LEVEL. </p> <p></p> <p>I’m still going to explain everything and keep it simple, but if you’re still lost, I recommend that you look this stuff up. </p> <p></p> <p>BEFORE WE START, I RECOMMEND YOU COVER MY LAST VIDEO ON THE BASICS OF BINARY EXPLOITATION. WE ARE STICKING WITH 64 BIT AS THIS IS WHAT IS COMMONLY USED TODAY!</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> </div> </div> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/RCEBinaryInjection" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;
