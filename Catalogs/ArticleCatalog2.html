I’m also going to show you how to botnet and command and control with the burp suite proxy server and how to strip any and all network traffic on a multitude of systems using it! </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "burp" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Burp Suite Proxy Server 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The burp suite proxy server is used to intercept and analyze network traffic and handle it in various ways. It is one of the most commonly used tools when testing against OWASP vulnerabilities within web application systems. THIS IS A STAPLE TOOL THAT YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO USE!</p> <p></p> <p>It can be used either for defense or for offense. In our case, we are going to talk about how it applies to offensive capabilities.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "proxy" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Proxy mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Burp suite has a feature in it that is called Proxy mode, where you can focus the tool on intercepting various network data communication methods. </p> <p></p> <p>With this particular method, you’ll be able to boot up a dummy browser session that can be used to test and track any communications that you personally send to a web application host target. Burp suite uses selenium in order to craft a test chromium browser session. </p> <p></p> <p>Why for yourself? Well, for starters, you can use the tool to gather in depth information on all the parameters and HTTP headers that are being sent to a target. You also have the ability to manipulate them and control how the server side will respond to you. It’s how hackers tend to test various fuzzing methods that will allow them to bypass security and exploit a system.</p> <p></p> <p>You can also use this feature to analyze any and all main scripts that are on the page, and follow network traffic as it pivots within the main internal, as well as any external domains that the tool might catch. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "foxy" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Foxy Proxy Mode (Firefox extension) 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now, this isn’t an exact feature that is a part of the main burp suite tool set, BUT, Firefox has a dedicated extension that allows you to set up a main proxy server on a system in order to forward all traffic to a main proxy server you have in a listening state.</p> <p></p> <p>This means that for an attacker, if we wanted to, and if we got creative, WE CAN BOTNET USING BURP SUITE. You can sit this on your system on a network, configure the extension on any and all systems on the network as well as the proxy server itself, and then BOOM, you can strip any and all network traffic, deciphering any and all credentials you can intercept.</p> <p></p> <p>You can also get creative and configure burp suite as a main proxy server within the network settings of the system you are looking to infect. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "intruder" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Intruder Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This mode is used for brute force based attacks, where you can send network traffic from the main HTTP socket history, and then handle it to inject word list points in them to have the tool brute force against. You can even set up the tool to allow stuff like pitch force brute forcing which is used to test against login time outs to bypass brute force protection on a main system.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "repeater" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Repeater Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Remember how I said that the burp suite tool can be used to manipulate the HTTP parameters and other information that is sent in the main request from client to server?</p> <p></p> <p>This mode allows you to do just that, store, modify, and repeat until you get a desired response form the server. This is crucial in case you wish to do stuff like SQL injection or RCE, and you need to see additional information that isn't shown to you from the main GUI of the site page. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "decoder" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Decoder Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This IS YOUR BREAD AND BUTTER IF YOU ARE FUZZING. What this mode allows you to do is type and encode as you need to, as well as being able to decode in case you need it to do so as well. </p> <p></p> <p>Let's say for example, you found a critical flaw in a system that allows you to RCE a server, but it doesn't allow white spaces or certain characters. It can be tricky jumping back and forth between an online encoder to handle the process for you. You can use this tool to handle all of that for you and craft a clean exploit if you need to inject some code into the target.</p> <p></p> <p>These are some of the basic core features and how they work for now.

I want to focus more on talking about the overall design of the two methods and the BIG flaws in them.</p> <p></p> <p>This article is a part of the new Danger! Series I’m launching, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p> <p>As always, any and all advanced versions of this article with a video guide if given will be for PAID patreon members only!!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "accessibility" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Accessibility vs Convenience in Cyber Security! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the biggest challenges we face when implementing new security features in an infrastructure is accessibility vs convenience, the overall means to implement a new security method while also making it convenient to use. </p> <p></p> <p>Accessibility allows the end user to easily understand and interpret/apply the new approach to security, allowing it to be seamlessly implemented into the security infrastructure in various ways. </p> <p></p> <p>This in return would require it to be more convenient in order to make it more accessible to them. Take token based MFA for example. All it is, is a simple pin code that is sent to the end user, so that they can input it into a system and authenticate on top of pre-existing knowledge factors that are set in place by default. For the sake of convenience, we have it set up so that the end user can receive the code in a variety of different ways: mobile SMS messages, email, authenticator apps, etc etc, various means spread out to allow them to use the method, which in the process, also makes it more accessible for them.</p> <p></p> <p>Sounds harmless right? WRONG. By making the method more convenient and accessible, we in fact increase the overall attack surface, making it more convenient and accessible for hackers to have options in order to exploit the security method that we’ve introduced. Don’t believe me? Check out my <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/danger-your-mobile-devices-vulnerable-roy-bull-futaba-webs--9u54e/?trackingId=OXrHkoIFT7mk8EkVhAcJkA%3D%3D&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3B7CUpqjxKRHaRgkH5R2N%2BAA%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;">“DANGER!Your Mobile Devices are VULNERABLE!”</a> article to learn about how one of these endpoints allows attackers to easily bypass the security method if needed. This of course, like all forms of MFA, varies depending on the layers that are within it. I’m of course ONLY talking about scenarios that involve the pin code method.</p> <p></p> <p>We need to be mindful that when implementing other endpoints for accessibility that can also apply the security method, we need to think several steps ahead, stuff like “is said endpoint secure enough to handle this feature?”, “what would happen in the event that it’s compromised”. We consistently get full of ourselves, thinking that the implementation of the method itself will suffice, that it is impenetrable, yet overlook the stuff like this, weaknesses that can turn it into rumble. </p> <p></p> <p>In terms of overall convenience, as harsh as this may sound, sometimes you need to limit how convenient it is to apply the method in order to ensure it's not easily exploitable. This can include from a wide range of stuff like either limiting how the user applies it, or, I some cases, how often the end user is required to use it, which leads into stuff like "Zero-Trust", which is a complex, yet secure form of security for any system infrastructure. I'll talk about that in another article. For now, let's stick to the main topic. </p> <p></p> <p>You can still make it more accessible and ensure that end users are able to use and implement it, but not TOO accessible if you see my main point? </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "argument" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Where am I going with this argument? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now, how does all of this apply to the topic up for discussion today? Well, believe it or not, SSO and OpenAuth, the main topic for today, as funny but not funny as this might sound, were MADE TO BE MORE CONVENIENT THAN IT IS SECURE. Don't believe me, well let me walk you through the overall concept of how these authentication methods function so that you see the point I’m trying to make. </p> <p></p> <p>Now, just to be CLEAR, I am NOT saying that whoever made this form of authentication method had the intention of NOT making it secure. I am simply just pointing out the major weaknesses in them based on how they were originally designed.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "sso">What is SSO (Single Sign On) 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Single sign on is the overall concept of being able to use ONE set of credentials to authenticate and log into multiple sessions with the same credentials that were used to authenticate to the first. Typically it’s used in infrastructures that have multiple sub layers or services that you would need to authenticate to. A good example of this would be WGU’s school system that deploys this method in order to allow you to authenticate to even your outlook mailbox with just your one session that you sign into the main student portal. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "openauth" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is OpenAuth 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This is a new form of authentication that is supposed to make sending over credentials a thing in the past, allowing you to basically send over passwordless credentials and authenticate to a system. This can also be done through mutual trusting parties such as the "Sign in with Google" option that you see on a lot of web applications that let you use your google log in session to authenticate.</p> <p></p> <p>This means that in theory if an attacker were to intercept a communication pipeline they would end up with nothing.</p> <p></p> <p>This method sounds lovely on paper, HOWEVER, there is one HUGE downfall to this… and why it needed some um… fixes cough requiring older security methods to patch it. It's one of the largest forms of a security breach waiting to happen. As a matter of fact it already has been. You can check a scenario on where OpenAuth is being used maliciously right <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/09/22/malicious-oauth-applications-used-to-compromise-email-servers-and-spread-spam/" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a> in order to infect and breach systems.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DangerSSOAndOpenAuth" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

In a sense you can think of this as a form of living off the land, where you are exploiting a trusted application within a system to gain and further extend access to a system infrastructure. The end goal of this method is much the same as many common attack vector end goals, RCE(remote code execution), which will allow you to botnet and control systems on the network further. </p> <p></p> <p>Hooking leads into stuff like DLL and Code injection which are used in order to hook and infect the memory pages of the target application, to launch malicious payloads from within the program itself. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "dll" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is DLL injection? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>DLL injection is the process of exploiting something that is known as a dynamic library, which are a series of core functions that are loaded alongside applications on startup for any and all general purposes. This is a trusted process that the system recognizes and allows the program to perform each time it runs. There are different types of DLL files, each one pertaining to a particular operating system: kernel32.dll for windows, ld. so. conf for linux, .dylib for MAC OS systems. </p> <p></p> <p>Essentially what we are doing using this injection method, is piggybacking off of the base address of where the DLL file is being loaded from on the system, in order to spoof our address as its address to come up as a legitimate process on the main system. This is also done on top of obfuscation methods to mask our activity on the system we are infecting. We need to blend in as much as possible in order to avoid being detected!</p> <p></p> <p>This allows us to mask in our own source code, which can be used in order to infect the system further.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "code" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Code injection 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Code injection is a much similar process much like DLL injection. The key difference here is that this is more focused around the masking of shell code that is converted to hexadecimal format, and then obfuscated in order to RCE the system.</p> <p></p> <p>These two methods can be combined in order to do both in one go if needed. You can use either or to get the job done! If you get creative with it, you can nest in RCE commands, that also pipe in source code for you to infect the system with.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://www.patreon.com/posts/pentest-phases-102728942" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

Series I’m launching, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "overeliance" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Over reliance on one set of tools or methods is a PROBLEM! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the biggest flaws in today's modern Cyber Security is the over reliance on a set of security methods/tools that one assumes is FULL PROOF secure with ZERO weaknesses. </p> <p></p> <p>This leads to us letting our guard down, not planning further ahead on the various ways hackers could bypass our various security methods: technical, physical, and operational, preventing us from developing contingency plans that could back us up in case said series of options fail. Cyber Security, as I’ve said before, is a game of chess, one that requires you to be several steps ahead in order to defend our digital landscape. </p> <p></p> <p>For one to assume there is no weakness in a system, no matter how well sound it might be, is a CRITICAL mistake, one that plagues the industry today stares at the MITIRE company data breach. Know this well… THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A 100% SECURE SYSTEM. For as long as it is man made it will always contain some form of flaw or error in them. People are able to make mistakes, therefore, said programs will also reflect said mistakes.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "bypass" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! MAC Address filtering can be bypassed! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Mac address filtering involves configuring a network access point to only allow permitted devices to authenticate and access the internal network. In the event that an unauthorized user tries to access the internal network, the MAC address that is tied to their system will be checked and flagged by the security of the access point if it isn’t registered as a permitted device. </p> <p></p> <p>For most this would appear as a great form of security overall. Only the administrator that configured the MAC address cache for the access point will be able to see which MAC addresses you need in order to be permitted to the network. Solid right? WRONG!</p> <p></p> <p>Here is the major flaw with this setup….. There are 2 EASY ways to bypass this rule.</p> <p></p> <p>#1:</p> <p></p> <p>You can tap into the direct network feed if you find an open PHYSICAL network port. This also allows you to bypass any authentication methods that might be set in place even if you manage to spoof the MAC address through other means and get blocked by the WPA2 authentication process.</p> <p></p> <p>Even if you find the right MAC address, if they have a complex password to join the network, then you’re out of luck if you try to do this the wireless method and you can't crack the password. It is possible to bypass using just the MAC address alone, but like all forms of wireless security, it's constantly improving and evolving over time, making some of these methods hard if not IMPOSSIBLE to easily pull off.</p> <p></p> <p>Physical network taps, which typically do NOT require authentication, allows you to bypass this simple filter. </p> <p></p> <p>#2:</p> <p></p> <p>The MAC addresses for any and all systems that are connected to the internal network are sent out in data packets, via “stations” that are connected to the main access point. </p> <p></p> <p>With a simple tool like Aircrack-ng, you can use monitoring mode to sniff out all the data channels and see which systems are connected to the network to spoof any and all internal MAC addresses, allowing you to bypass the security and authenticate to the network. </p> <p></p> <p>Of course there are other means to do this, but these are methods that I have tried and have succeeded with that have allowed me to breach access points that I have personally setup for these types of tests.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "hiding" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! Hiding your SSID can be bypassed 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A common trick that a lot of people like to use in order to prevent unauthorized network breaches, is they like to hide their SSID’s which is the name of the network. This is effective in that you can hide SSID information from common means of exposure, like the GUI you use when selecting a wireless access point to communicate with.</p> <p></p> <p>The problem with this is it can easily be bypassed by the same method mentioned in option #2 of how to bypass MAC address filtering. </p> <p></p> <p>Your SSID is also broadcasted along with any and all MAC address information that is sent out in data packets. They have to be, otherwise our IoT devices would be unable to pick them up and identify them. THERE IS ALWAYS A WAY TO BYPASS ANYTHING! NOTHING IS 100 PERCENT SECURE!</p> <p></p> <p>Today’s positive bonuses will focus more on how to defend against MAC address filtering bypasses, preventing an attacker from breaching the network via this security method.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "hhttps://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DangerSSIDMACFILTERING" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

It's the overall process of enumerating the entire file system, and then applying what is known as symmetric cryptography in order to encrypt the entire data storage medium. A good example of this would be bitlocker, which is commonly used for Windows system infrastructures.</p> <p></p> <p>As you know, data encryption is irreversible without the crypto keys, so by performing this method and leaving the keys out the hands of the attacker, should they breach the system, whether it be digitally or physically, any and all data they steal will be useless to them.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "cookies" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What are COOKIES? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Symmetric cryptography, also known as single key cryptography, is the process of using a singular crypto key known as a private key in order to both encrypt as well as decrypt data. It's commonly more used for FDE over Asymmetric due to it being the faster encryption method.</p> <p></p> <p>This makes sense as the overall process for FDE is to enumerate THE ENTIRE file system ENTIRELY and encrypt EVERY single file on the system. Asymmetric would be too slow for this as it's a slower encryption standard. It's also commonly used in mobile device data encryption as well for the same reasons.</p> <p></p> <p>Asymmetric encryption on the other hand uses two crypto keys to perform the same process, except, in this case, it uses a public key for encryption, and a private key for decryption. The main reason for this is to add more secure complexity for various data communication methods. It’s also commonly used in stuff like PGP, pretty good privacy, which is commonly used for secure email data encryption.</p> <p></p> <p>One of the BIGGEST downfalls of symmetric data encryption is it's VULNERABLE to interception attacks. Should an attacker intercept the crypto key, they can: decrypt all data and messages, replay new ones on behalf of the original recipients, and a lot more.</p> <p></p> <p>However, with Asymmetric encryption, this isn't the case. Since it uses two crypto keys which come in pairs, Should a threat actor intercept the communication pipeline and steal one of the keys, their efforts will be in vain, as they lack one of the means to facilitate a SOLID man in the middle attack.</p> <p></p> <p>The whole premise of a man in the middle attack is to not only intercept the communication, but to reply messages on behalf of the respective parties. By using public key cryptography on top of other data channel splitting techniques, you render this the ineffective and leave them in a situation where they can’t facilitate it fully.</p> <p></p> <p>Should an attacker secure the public key only, then they'll only be able to send messages. They won't be able to read any of the data that is being sent back and forth, and any new messages will be suspected as false ones, which will lead to the replacing of the keys. Even if they verify with the key, it will all be for nothing.</p> <p></p> <p>However, in the event they have the private key, they'll be able to decrypt any and all messages, BUT, they won't be able to spoof and gain further insight and other information out of the communication pipeline. This is still a problem for them due to the fact most PKI infrastructures, even stuff like PGP, REQUIRE you to have the public key BEFORE you begin a communication to ensure message authenticity from the recipients. Simply not having the public key is like a lack of ID to verify who you are…. WHICH MEANS A DEAD PRIVATE KEY! This does vary depending on the infrastructure so do be mindful as I'm going over this.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "cookiehijacking" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Cookie Session Hijacking? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now that we've gone over the basics, let's talk about what Ransomware is.</p> <p></p> <p>Ransomware is basically FDE with malicious intent. It's a form of malware that is known as "crypto" malware, which deploys cryptographic techniques that enumerate the victims file system, exfiltrating data from it, and then encrypting the main copy of the data on the file system, rendering it useless to them. Be mindful that "crypto" malware and "ransomware" are TWO different forms of malware. Crypto malware is the main archetype, where as Ransomware is the child of said archetype, inheriting cryptographic techniques. </p> <p></p> <p>After the data is encrypted, a message is displayed to the end user requiring them to pay a "ransom" in order to receive the crypto keys to decrypt their data, hence the name "ransomware". The problem with this is paying the ransom doesn't guarantee you will receive the keys.</p> <p></p> <p>Ransomware is on the rise for being an effective attack method because it can be combined with phage malware techniques and phishing techniques to become SUPER effective.</p> <p></p> <p>Before, a simple click of the link or mishap in security meant you had an undetected botnet. NOW, it means all your data is encrypted and unreadable, which can be problematic if you're handling sensitive data that has to do with critical record information like someone's student or home loan payment information for example.</p> <p></p> <p>Mr.Robot for example, one of their biggest exploits in the show was encrypting all of E Corp's data in order to "FREE" everyone from debt. HOWEVER, it caused quite the opposite effect, where now people that were close to being debt free, or had funds in their bank accounts, were unable to access anything or prove what they've made payments due to the data being indecipherable. The result? TOTAL CHAOS where the people they were trying to “Free” suffered more.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/CookieSessionHijacking" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

The goal of the research project is to help educate small businesses run by women and other minority groups on proper Cyber Security practices. The QA was led by a woman named Grace Sommers. If you would like all the full in depth answers regarding the QA, you can find it on my patreon attached to the advanced version of this article. It's 9 pages and you can learn a lot about how to properly defend your digital systems from various attack vectors, including various endpoint security methods if that fancies you.</p> <p></p> <p>The more advanced version of this article is going to feature some more in depth techniques aside from the basic ones that will be discussed here today. As always, that will be for my patreon supporters only.</p> <p></p> <p>This article is a part of the Danger! Series, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p> <p></p> <p>Ransomware attacks are on the rise, and are a favorable attack method commonly used by a lot of crypto gangs. It's important to know how to protect yourself from these types of attacks. Ransomware, as shocking as this might sound, is EASY to stop, rather, easy to render useless. It's simply a matter of understanding the critical flaw within the attack method itself and what it relies on to execute.</p> <p></p> <p>Even with all of this you still need to know proper data mitigation techniques, since the attack method also focuses on data exfiltration. I'm going to teach you various mitigation strategies that not only protect you from ransomware attacks, BUT, protect various data endpoints to prevent exfiltration. Why? Even if you render a ransomware attack from crippling your infrastructure, the attacker STILL got away with sensitive data which they can use as they please. You need to observe all the little things to see the bigger picture.</p> <p></p> <p>I'll also be covering some basic stuff like FDE, cryptography, etc, so that you FULLY understand how the attack method works. Pay close attention to the cryptography stuff since you NEED to understand how it works, both from the perspective of a threat actor, as well as from an overall security standpoint perspective.</p> <p></p> <p>If you would like a demonstration of the technique, I wrote an article demonstrating how to write the code and perform the technique, as well as a live demonstration that can be found on my YouTube channel. If you would like to see the sample code for it, you can find it in my "Python-Pen-Testing-Tools" in my main Github Repository <a href = "https://github.com/RoyMBull/Python-Pen-Testing-Tools/blob/main/Python%20PenTesting%20Tools/Ransomeware.py" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "fde" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is FDE (Full disk encryption)? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Before we dive into what Ransomware is, let's go over what FDE is, since it heavily applies to the topic for today.</p> <p></p> <p>FDE, full disk encryption, is a defensive technique that is used to harden data protection across all hierarchical flat file systems. It's the overall process of enumerating the entire file system, and then applying what is known as symmetric cryptography in order to encrypt the entire data storage medium. A good example of this would be bitlocker, which is commonly used for Windows system infrastructures.</p> <p></p> <p>As you know, data encryption is irreversible without the crypto keys, so by performing this method and leaving the keys out the hands of the attacker, should they breach the system, whether it be digitally or physically, any and all data they steal will be useless to them.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "crypto" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Symmetric/Asymmetric Cryptography? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Symmetric cryptography, also known as single key cryptography, is the process of using a singular crypto key known as a private key in order to both encrypt as well as decrypt data. It's commonly more used for FDE over Asymmetric due to it being the faster encryption method.</p> <p></p> <p>This makes sense as the overall process for FDE is to enumerate THE ENTIRE file system ENTIRELY and encrypt EVERY single file on the system. Asymmetric would be too slow for this as it's a slower encryption standard. It's also commonly used in mobile device data encryption as well for the same reasons.</p> <p></p> <p>Asymmetric encryption on the other hand uses two crypto keys to perform the same process, except, in this case, it uses a public key for encryption, and a private key for decryption. The main reason for this is to add more secure complexity for various data communication methods. It’s also commonly used in stuff like PGP, pretty good privacy, which is commonly used for secure email data encryption.</p> <p></p> <p>One of the BIGGEST downfalls of symmetric data encryption is it's VULNERABLE to interception attacks. Should an attacker intercept the crypto key, they can: decrypt all data and messages, replay new ones on behalf of the original recipients, and a lot more.</p> <p></p> <p>However, with Asymmetric encryption, this isn't the case. Since it uses two crypto keys which come in pairs, Should a threat actor intercept the communication pipeline and steal one of the keys, their efforts will be in vain, as they lack one of the means to facilitate a SOLID man in the middle attack.</p> <p></p> <p>The whole premise of a man in the middle attack is to not only intercept the communication, but to reply messages on behalf of the respective parties. By using public key cryptography on top of other data channel splitting techniques, you render this the ineffective and leave them in a situation where they can’t facilitate it fully.</p> <p></p> <p>Should an attacker secure the public key only, then they'll only be able to send messages. They won't be able to read any of the data that is being sent back and forth, and any new messages will be suspected as false ones, which will lead to the replacing of the keys. Even if they verify with the key, it will all be for nothing.</p> <p></p> <p>However, in the event they have the private key, they'll be able to decrypt any and all messages, BUT, they won't be able to spoof and gain further insight and other information out of the communication pipeline. This is still a problem for them due to the fact most PKI infrastructures, even stuff like PGP, REQUIRE you to have the public key BEFORE you begin a communication to ensure message authenticity from the recipients. Simply not having the public key is like a lack of ID to verify who you are…. WHICH MEANS A DEAD PRIVATE KEY! This does vary depending on the infrastructure so do be mindful as I'm going over this.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "ransomware" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Ransomware? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now that we've gone over the basics, let's talk about what Ransomware is.</p> <p></p> <p>Ransomware is basically FDE with malicious intent. It's a form of malware that is known as "crypto" malware, which deploys cryptographic techniques that enumerate the victims file system, exfiltrating data from it, and then encrypting the main copy of the data on the file system, rendering it useless to them. Be mindful that "crypto" malware and "ransomware" are TWO different forms of malware. Crypto malware is the main archetype, where as Ransomware is the child of said archetype, inheriting cryptographic techniques. </p> <p></p> <p>After the data is encrypted, a message is displayed to the end user requiring them to pay a "ransom" in order to receive the crypto keys to decrypt their data, hence the name "ransomware". The problem with this is paying the ransom doesn't guarantee you will receive the keys.</p> <p></p> <p>Ransomware is on the rise for being an effective attack method because it can be combined with phage malware techniques and phishing techniques to become SUPER effective.</p> <p></p> <p>Before, a simple click of the link or mishap in security meant you had an undetected botnet. NOW, it means all your data is encrypted and unreadable, which can be problematic if you're handling sensitive data that has to do with critical record information like someone's student or home loan payment information for example.</p> <p></p> <p>Mr.Robot for example, one of their biggest exploits in the show was encrypting all of E Corp's data in order to "FREE" everyone from debt. HOWEVER, it caused quite the opposite effect, where now people that were close to being debt free, or had funds in their bank accounts, were unable to access anything or prove what they've made payments due to the data being indecipherable. The result? TOTAL CHAOS where the people they were trying to “Free” suffered more.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "strategy" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What should you do during a Ransomware Attack? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the biggest misconceptions about ransomware attacks, a common question that gets asked, is what do you do in the event of a ransomware data breach? This is a VERY bad question to ask, as it under prepares many business infrastructures on how to deal with actual ransomware threats.</p> <p></p> <p>The real practical question to ask is what do you do BEFORE a ransomware attack occurs? Still scratching your head? Let me explain.</p> <p></p> <p>You see, in the event that a ransomware attack connects, THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO!!!! Ransomware is an IRREVERSIBLE process, where unless you have the crypto keys, which are in the hands of the attacker, there is NOTHING you can do. Even if you pay the ransom, you're not guaranteed to be given the crypto keys to re-acquire the data that has been stolen. You also have loads of fines that stack along with the ransomware breach that you are required to report on top of that.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "mitigation" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the simplest means to prevent damage from this type of attack? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the SIMPLEST yet COMMONLY ignored methods to prevent ransomware from being super effective BEFORE it strikes is the usage of constant data backups. There are two main types: inferential and differential backups.</p> <p></p> <p>Differential backups are full backups where you backup any and all data across the board. This is done at certain time frames regularly to back up large quantities of data at a time.</p> <p></p> <p>Incremental backups are partial backups where you backup portions of data at a time. This is common practice on top of the differential one as you'll often have a case where certain portions of data need to be backed up. Think of it like this, if you modified a file on your flash drive, would you back up the entire drive again? Doesn't make sense right? This is where you would apply this method.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DangerRansomware" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

I'll even cover one of the best FREE beginner tools that you can use to apply the technique in a more automated fashion.</p> <p></p> <p>If you would like to see how to perform remote file inclusion, as well as the best means to do so, then I suggest checking out this video <a href = "https://www.patreon.com/posts/lab-python-104381028" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a> from my patreon lab for the TCPBackdoor exploit.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "remote" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Remote File inclusion? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Remote file inclusion is the process of directly uploading malicious files/payloads to a remote web application server in order to have it become a part of the main file archives that belong to it.. This allows the threat actor to infect and or control the web application on a massive scale, as well as deliver unsuspecting payloads to end users that use said service. If done correctly. it can lead to the compromising of many end user networks and IoT devices if not mitigated correctly.</p> <p></p> <p>As you know, web application servers use the HTTP/HTTPS protocol to host various html files that end users can access through the internet on behalf of a web browser application. When you visit a website, you're auto directed to the main HTML index page welcoming you to the site. From there the end user browses the site through the main UI(user interface) which will allow them to view any and all HTML pages that are hosted on the web application, as well as any other fields that might be included with it.</p> <p></p> <p>Web applications, as I’ve mentioned earlier, host various other files that are accessible to the end user, like executables, that are auto downloaded to their system the moment they visit the resource location on the server.</p> <p></p> <p>For example: https://website[.]com/Download.exe (JUST AN EXAMPLE! IT'S NOT REAL)</p> <p></p> <p>When you visit this link, it will download a file that is known simply as "Download.exe". Much like how when you visit an HTML page, it's automatically displayed and interpreted on the screen for you, downloadable non HTML files are auto downloaded to your system for you to use.</p> <p></p> <p>Remote file inclusion exploits both of these things discussed about web applications in 2 ways.</p> <p></p> <p>#1, it can host fake pages and replace the pre-existing ones with spoofed pages that are malicious.</p> <p></p> <p>Ever heard of a website that was hacked, and suddenly all the "legitimate" web pages on it were now all malicious and infected end user systems? Well this is how REAL threat actors go about it when they compromise a web application.</p> <p></p> <p>By exploiting this vulnerability in a LEGITIMATE web application, you not only trick the web browser and security in place to protect the end user from spoofed sites, BUT, you also trick the end user into visiting pages that are malicious, allowing them to steal sensitive credentials, and even land a botnet onto the end user network should they want to extend their overall attack surface.</p> <p></p> <p>#2, it can be used to host executables that are auto downloaded to the victim's system</p> <p></p> <p>It's no shocker that one of the bread and butters for a threat actor is to use this technique to host malicious payloads that are auto downloaded to the victim's system. This can be deadly if it's a majorly trusted executable whose signature is also spoofed and ran on the target system.</p> <p></p> <p>Imagine VSCode, a desktop application that is commonly trusted and downloaded onto millions of systems daily, suddenly replaced with a fake version that was trusted by any and all end user systems? This would lead to a massive breach on many systems, as it's also possible for an attacker to spoof the signature of the software to bypass security. They can even do stuff like DLL and Code injection, as well as many obfuscation techniques to go undetected. The list goes on with the amount of creativity and devastating dama that can be done should an attacker land this critical flaw against a well trusted system</p> <p></p> <p>#3 it can allow you to pull of RCE and directory traversal</p> <p></p> <p>If you manage to pop a php file to a web application, you basically have a remote backdoor into the system that you can tap into whenever you need to and further extend your reach to the network the web application is hosted on.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "local" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is local file inclusion? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Local file inclusion, also known as directory traversal, is a technique that allows you to browse the web application's file system. This isn't a form of RCE no, BUT, it does allow you to browse stuff that is outside the bounds of the web application root directory.</p> <p></p> <p>As mentioned before, when you visit a web application you are accessing the HTML files via the file system of the web application.</p> <p></p> <p>For security reasons, in order to prevent you from accessing files outside those bounds, you are prohibited from being able to view anything that is not a part of the main web application root directory that is configured for it.</p> <p></p> <p>Directory traversal bypasses this security and allows you to access any and all files that are sensitive on the system.</p> <p></p> <p>This can also lead to RCE because should you, in the event there is an open SSH service for example, should you happen to find the credentials to connect with the right privileges, you can extend your attack surface.</p> <p></p> <p>You can also view any and all sensitive files to gain access to password data that can allow you to compromise any services that are tied to the web application, such as the administrative credentials for login pages if they happen to be there.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "difference" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The difference between the two? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The biggest overall difference between remote file inclusion and local file inclusion, is that remote file inclusion is more you uploading and or replacing legitimate files on the web application to infect it.</p> <p></p> <p>Local file inclusion is more used to browse the system to find sensitive files and or credentials. You can exploit this in various ways, even through programs on the file system that print text data from various files in the web application system.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "rce" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is RCE? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>RCE, RCE, RCE! You’ve been hearing me say this a lot, but I haven’t quite yet explained what it means right? </p> <p></p> <p>RCE, remote code execution, is the main goal and bread and butter for any and all forms of injection exploits against any system. It's commonly applied to various things: buffer overflows via obfuscated malware, remote code execution, SQL injection, etc. It’s also just a common end game for any form of breach. </p> <p></p> <p>Your end goal is to always find a way to RCE a system in order to control it directly via shell code commands, which can be combined with various coding techniques to deal more damage.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/RemoteLocalFileInclusion" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

It also has much more fine tune options that let you control the overall quality of the attack itself. </br> </br> Disclaimer </br> </br> As always, personal disclaimer, any and all information for this is strictly for educational purposes and I do not condone any form of illegal activity, nor am I responsible for anything you should use this information for.

In the more advanced version of the articles, I’m going to go over how some of the core API functions work, and how we can exploit them. Much like how in the DLL injection article where I mention there will be a followup article later on with live footage to show the exploit, the same will be the case with this article as well. This is to ensure you have the proper knowledge and that it marinates before we dive into the real thing. </p> <p></p> <p>Security is something that is HIGHLY neglected during many software development projects. I’ve talked a bit about this before, but if security is not kept in mind, it can lead to some pretty crazy stuff, like for example, OpenAuth and SSO. If you would like to see what I’m talking about in regards to that, you can check out this article <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/danger-sso-openauth-roy-bull-futaba-webs--8lkbe/?trackingId=mm8l%2FgXVSROEv2isf8NLvg%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>. </p> <p></p> <p>This article is a part of the Danger! Series, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "recall" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Windows Recall? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Windows recall is a new “snapshot” feature for Windows 11, where around every 5 seconds, the state of the system is essentially ‘screenshoted”, recording and saving the main state of the system, so that you can return back to a period in time and pick up where you left off. </p> <p></p> <p>The best analogy for this would be like the screenshot method for virtual machines, where you can “screenshot” where you’re currently at on the system and resume your progress later on when you need to. It’s also portable, so if you happen to snapshot the system, you can carry it to another VM of the same type and then pop it there. </p> <p></p> <p>Windows Recall is a part of the main Windows Copilot Runtime , which is an AI based API.</p> <p></p> <p>It relies on the User Activity API, which is a C# focused API, in order to create screenshots and encapsulate sessions that have to do with the end user data that is on the system: Overall user activity, data, data accounts, as well as any and all tasks that were running on the main system at the time.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "screenshot" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a system screenshot? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>System screenshots, often performed for virtual machines, is a mechanic that allows you to screenshot the entire state of the local system from all various endpoints: memory, tasks, running browser sessions and any cookie data with it, etc. </p> <p></p> <p>Think of it like “quick save” when you are playing a video game. Once you reach a certain checkpoint, OR, after a certain period of time, the game will “save” itself, in which, depending on the game, you can go back in time and pick up where you left off. </p> <p></p> <p>System snapshots is also a technique that is commonly used for forensics purposes, weather it be maliciously or defensively. It can be used, for example, to retrieve crypto keys that are often stored in memory while during live run time of the system. This can be vital for data recovery purposes in case you lost the keys, OR, in the eyes of an attacker, it can be used to decrypt any and al sensitive data with it to compromise a system infrastructure. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "caution" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">CAUTION! READ FIRST! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Since Windows Recall is fairly new, these are just theories on how it can be exploited, which is not fully set in stone until people exploit it (which many have done so already). </p> <p></p> <p>Feel free to theorize and let me know various other ways this feature can be exploited and drop a comment in the comments section bellow. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "negative" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! Recall renders data sanitation INEFFECTIVE!? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Windows Recall renders stuff like data sanitation methods on the system useless.</p> <p></p> <p>Wiped a few crpyo keys for proper toss the key method? Recall will help threat actors restore the system so they can retrieve it!</p> <p></p> <p>Deleted files and purged them from the system so no one could view them and have a digital certificate verifying the wipe? RECALL WILL HELP THREAT ACTORS RESTORE THE SYSTEM SO THEY CAN RETRIEVE IT!</p> <p></p> <p>See where I'M going with this? No matter what you do, threat actors are able to essentially go back in time and revert the process since the main state of the system has been PERFECTLY saved in memory. At this point it's also a forensics tool for hackers in this case for data retrieval. </p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DangerSSIDMACFILTERING" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;
