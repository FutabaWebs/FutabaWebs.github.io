These two techniques are your bread and butter and are what you’ll be going for during a lot of pentests, CTF challenges, etc, regardless of how you go about it: SQL injection, OS command injection, remote file inclusion, etc. It’s really all the same. If you’ve ever noticed, during a lot of big hacks, one of the most common things that ALWAYS happens is that the attackers somehow discover a way to RCE the system, allowing them to gain backdoor access and formulate something called a “botnet”, allowing them to deliver various payloads and command and control the network. Before I dive into this, as always I want to get you up to speed on some terminology so that you understand what’s going on. Let’s go over the main TCP/IP handshake so you understand the overall process. </br> </br> <strong style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;"> <im> Disclaimer</im></strong> </br> </br> As always, personal disclaimer, any and all information for this is strictly for educational purposes and I do not condone any form of illegal activity, nor am I responsible for anything you should use this information for. DO NOT pen-test on anyone's network unless it is your own, or you have permission to do so. Now, let's begin! </p> </br> </br> <h4 id = "tcp" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the TCP/IP 3-way-hand-shake? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>First, In order for you to fully understand how all of this works, we need to go over the TCP/IP 3-way-handshake, as well as how sockets/ports work, and how all of this ties in together. This carries over on a fundamental level and gets you into the habit of understanding how network data communications function on a logical and "visual" level. </p> <p></p> <p>Let’s start off with the classic Web application example. When you visit a web application, you begin a process that is known as the TCP/IP handshake, which occurs in 3 steps via flags set in ICMP data packets: SYN, where the client is initiating a connection to the server, SYN/ACK, where the server responds, acknowledging the session being inquired, followed by ACK, which is the client side sends to finalize and begin the connection to the server. All of this also applies to the basic principles of how systems talk to each other over a network, which is what makes up the internet as a whole as it’s just a larger scale of that. </p> </br> </br> <h4 id = "backdoor" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a BackDoor? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Backdoors, also known as RAT, remote access Trojan, is the form of interconnecting two systems together maliciously in order to send data and or control a system. It can vary depending on what it’s needed for. In most cases it’s used as a way to botnet, command and control, and RCE a system. Stuff like a meterpreter shell in metasploit is a common example that is often used. It’s also known as a reverse shell exploit which is the same concept.</p> <p></p> <p>As the name would suggest, often it’s used via Trojan malware methods, or “companion” viruses that trick the user into clicking on it with stuff like “fake adds” or “false program icons” on your computer screen. Once you click on it, you’ve given the attacker access to your system. </p> </br> </br> <h4 id = "rce" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is RCE? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>RCE, remote code execution, is when you are able to remotely control a system via shell code commands Shell code commands are terminal commands, things like bash and powershell for example. For hackers, this can be achieved in a variety of different ways. SQL injection for example can achieve this via the “system” command feature that comes packaged with SQL. SQL allows you to use this to send shell code commands to the main system. This means that if you are able to pwn a server via SQL injection you also have the potential to RCE it in the process. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "botnet" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a Botnet? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Botnetting is the overall process of infecting a variety of different systems on a network, controlling them like bots/zombies in order to further one’s access to the network, compromising the IT infrastructure further. This takes place during the maintaining access step of the pentesting methodology, and is where you establish ways to stay connected to a compromised network. This goes into something that is known as command in control. </p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "cmc" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is command and control? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Command and control is when you control, as the botmaster of the botnet, all the systems on the network and do regular checks on them to see if they are still alive. Think of it as you “blueteaming” for your “botnet”. For example, you can do stuff like beacons, which sends data packets to check if the system is still alive, or even install logs so that you get regular status updates on them. </p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "clientserver" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the difference between Client and Server? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>VERY CRUCIAL, and this is something that will play a vital role in your understanding of the difference between client and server. A client connects and sends data to the server, and a server “listens”. What do I mean by that? Servers have open ports that are in a listening state that wait for incoming connections and data from clients, and then handles and responds to them accordingly. The best way to think of this would be in the sense of ordering from an actual server via a restaurant menu. You put in an order, and then the server responds by delivering it to you. </p> <p></p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/WomensHistoryMonth2025" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a> </div>`;

A lot of this is going to be heavy networking based, so do mind your fundamentals. I'll explain some stuff along the way. As always, personal disclaimer, any and all information for this is strictly for educational purposes and I do not condone any form of illegal activity, nor am I responsible for anything you should use this information for. DO NOT pentest on anyone's network unless it is your own, or you have permission to do so. </br> </br> <strong> <im> Disclaimer</im></strong> </br> </br> As always, personal disclaimer, any and all information for this is strictly for educational purposes and I do not condone any form of illegal activity, nor am I responsible for anything you should use this information for.

Now, let's begin! </p> </br> </br> <h4 id = "premise" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Premise 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>In order to walk you through how to perform the technique, lets go over a few things first like: ARP, pingsweep, and spoofing. ARP, address resolution protocol, is what NSlookup is, but for MAC addresses. ARP translates the corresponding MAC address back to the IP of the system it pertained to. Pingsweeping is the process of pinging a series of IP addresses via a network range to check for ICMP responses. No response typically indicates a system is not up, a response indicates the system is up. There are a variety of different scan types, each with unique return results. Spoofing is the concept of masquerading as another entity, whether it be a machine, such as a spoofed MAC address, or a person for social engineering exploits, such as a spoofed ID badge for example. Now that we have the basics covered out of the way, lets begin!</p> <p></p> <p>As always, any and all advanced versions of this article with a video guide if given will be for PAID patreon members only!!</p> </br> </br> <h4 id = "arp" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is ARP Poisoning? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>How does ARP poisoning work? Essentially you are masquerading your IP and MAC address on the internal network as another system in order to receive any network traffic data intended for it. When you communicate on the network, whether it be internally (the local network) or externally (a web server), the default gateway, your router, handles the communication for you and routes it on your behalf. When you receive a response it also handles and forwards that information to you as well. If you masquerade as another system on the network, it's essentially going to send you a copy of the return information from the victim as well. In the process, since you are also on that same system on the network, you'll also be able to see any outgoing network traffic from the victim itself and receive a copy of that as well. This means that if any of those communications are insecure, such as HTTP for example, you'll be able to see any and all data in plain text format. If the victim sent over any POST HTTP request data for example, you will be able to see any credentials they sent over to authenticate to a web server. This methodology is what is also known as a form of a man in the middle attack exploit. A Man in the Middle attack is when you intercept a communication for one or more parties involved and either steal or forward that data, manipulating it, as if you were the original sender, unsuspected to said parties involved.</p> </br> </br> <h4 id = "subnetting" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Subnetting? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>You might be asking yourself what is a subnet? Subnets are essentially networks that have been fragmented into smaller sub networks, hence subnetting. Each subnet is assigned a unique "subnet mask", the "/24" that you see here, that allows you to identify each subnet. Each subnet has it's own pool of IP addresses that can be assigned to members of that particular subnet. This allows for segmentation practices that prevent stuff like single point of failures, which are essentially monolithic based infrastructures that nest everything into one place. For network security purposes, when you do this you make it HARD for attackers to find everything, decreasing your attack surface, securing your systems greatly. With subnetting it's also possible to control which subnets can talk to each other, which is the main reason we begin a main hunt for them via the route and traceroute commands.</p> </br> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br> </br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/ARP_Poisoning" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a> </div>`;

I'm not going to directly tap into a camera feed live as that's illegal (even if it's a public cam for a park), but I am going to show you how to talk to specific ports using an IP address, whether it be in numeral format or alphabetical format.

Now, let's begin! </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "premise" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Premise 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>For this demonstration, since we'll be using metasploit for it, you're going to need a Shodan premium membership to get a lifetime API key(s). Sadly, Shodan now requires you to be a premium member if you wish to use the API freely. </p> <p></p> <p>You can still query searches on the site if you are looking for something and tap into feeds via GUI, but you won't have access to the full features of the core API if you wish to craft your own exploits with them via metasploit and your own code for example.</p> <p></p> <p>Link to <a href = "https://shodan.io/" style = "text-decoration: none;">Shodan</a></p> <p></p> <p>Like always, before we dive into the actual exploit, let's touch up on a bit of terminology and major concepts so that you understand how the overall process works. Wouldn't be a good article without that.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "api" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is an API? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>You've probably heard this term a lot, and probably need a bit of clarification on what this is. An API (Application programming interface) is essentially the core biological functions that make up a computer program. In most cases nowadays it's used in context with "automation" software for web applications, stuff like the "Shodan API" for example, that have core integrated functions that allow you to query information about IoT devices on the web. Another example of an API, would be a kernel, which pertains to the core functions that make up an operating system, and dictates how hardware and software interact with each other, allowing you to control the system. </p> <p></p> <p>Another good example would be the Windows32 API, that hackers and researchers use for stuff like DLL and Code injections to hook and hijack Windows system processes. They can also use it for little pranks like preventing you from opening your CD Drive, or shutting off your monitor by broadcasting a system command to all handles on the main system, shutting it off and on as they please. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "shodan" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the Shodan API? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The Shodan API is an OSINT tool that is used to track and gather information about various IoT gateway devices (routers), services hosted on them, as well as their corresponding IP's that are connected to the internet. This allows you to gain insight and exploit various services hosted on them and tap into things like: CCTV surveillance systems, home security systems, as well as file sharing services, SSH services, and of course, WEB APPLICATION services. You can also exploit any vulnerabilities that are in the firmware of the router itself, allowing you to pwn it and compromise the internal network.</p> <p></p> <p>Fun fact, when you are talking to a web server, you aren't actually talking to the main system itself directly, you are talking to the router that is hosting the service on behalf of it, indirectly. This also comes into play when you are port scanning with NMAP. When you scan with NMAP, you're actually scanning the router that is hosting many services on behalf of other systems on the internal network, or a singular one if that's the case.</p> <p></p> <p>As we know, the internet is made up of various communication devices, routers, that interconnect to one another, allowing end users to exchange data, access services like web applications (web sites), and communicate over the internet. All of this is possible through a technique known as port forwarding, that allows internal networks to safely communicate with each other. The internet wouldn't be possible without it, and without it, internal networks and highly sensitive information would be highly exposed and easily compromised.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "router" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a Router? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A router is a form of network communication device that is used to host a network, forward communications to and from the network via DNS, domain name server, as well as assign IP addresses to systems that are on the local network.

SQL injection exploits invalid user input, input that isn't properly validated when being handled to the server side from the client side when the end user performs a query to the server: logins, searches, etc. This allows you to take advantage of the input you send to manipulate the server-side back-end to retrieve additional data that isn't intended for you. This allows you to access stuff like: additional information from the main database table you are linked to, additional database tables, and additional functions and or features of the back-end of the database that you are talking to such as system command features that allow you to pivot and hijack the system further for OS command injection exploits. You can even manipulate the very privileges that are set for you and upgrade yourself to admin if you wanted to either via OS command injection if system commands are enabled on the SQL server, or via the usage of SQL queries that you can use to edit your information in the system. The possibilities are endless and are only limited based on the scope of your imagination. If you are wondering what OS command injection exploits are, it's essentially where you inject shell-code commands like bash and power-shell to the server side end to control the system directly. The overall premise of injection methods is to exploit the processes and features of the server side you are talking to in order to control it. This requires you to do a bit of recon on how the server works in order to understand what weak points to look for. We'll eventually cover how to search for injection types a system might be vulnerable to.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "tcp" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is TCP/IP? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>But first, In order for you to fully understand how SQL injection works, we need to go over the TCP/IP 3-way-handshake. This carries over on a fundamental level and gets you into the habit of understanding how network data communications function on a logical and "visual" level. SQL injection is often hard due to a lot of people unable to "visualize" how the process works. Visualization is KEY in tech, especially Cyber Security.</p> <p></p> <p>When you visit a web application, you begin a process that is known as the TCP/IP handshake, which occurs in 3 steps via flags set in ICMP data packets: SYN, where the client is initiating a connection to the server, SYN/ACK, where the server responds, acknowledging the session being inquired, followed by ACK, which the client sends to finalize and begin the connection to the server. SQL queries follow a similar order: you input data into the parameter of a web application, and then that information is processed into a structured query, and then sent to the server side for processing on the back-end, in which the server responds back to you and you acknowledge it.</p> <p></p> <p>A good place to get a visual demonstration of what I'm talking about in regards to SQL injection can be found here at this link.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "tcp" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is TCP/IP? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>But first, In order for you to fully understand how SQL injection works, we need to go over the TCP/IP 3-way-handshake.

The client side is going to be integrated with Arduino, where it will will write its own code live and connect back to the server, whereas the server side, the python script, is going to sit in a listening state on the system, waiting for the client to connect to it so it can be fed instructions from the client side to control the system. Traditionally you always want to have the server sitting on the victim system so that you can connect and interact with it, but nowadays making your back-doors peer to peer is actually best because it allows your setup to be more versatile. For safety purposes, it's just going to connect back and that's it, nothing else! The real version that is unsafe to use stays with me. </p> <p></p> <p>Sadly, this is one of those projects that you NEED to have the right equipment for to pull off, but you can still follow along the 2 demonstration videos here.

Before I answer that question, I first need to explain to you what FDE(Full Disk Encryption) is. FDE is basically stuff like Bitlocker, where it enumerates the file system and encrypts data on the system in order to prevent data theft. In this case, it’s used for defensive purposes. BUT, what if I told you, it could be used maliciously? That’s what Ransomware is. It's a form of crypto malware that uses FDE to maliciously enumerate and encrypt file system data, holding it hostage, with the crypto keys left in the hands of the attacker, forcing the victim to pay a ransom in order to retrieve the keys to decrypt the data. The real data is excavated off the system in the process with the encrypted version remaining on the system. </p> <p></p> <p>Now you might be asking yourself, how do hackers create such complex and intricate malware? It must be so complex and time consuming to write right? Well... it's actually not that hard to write. All you're really doing is combining basic file disk enumeration tactics with either asymmetric or symmetric encryption methods, and some other things to spice it up a bit. I've actually prepared a test sample for today's study, as well as a demonstration video to show you how the code works. </p> <p></p> <p>Link to the main the demonstration video can be found <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh15ZOUWVcg" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>.</p> <p></p> <p>Link to the main Code can be found <a href = "https://github.com/RoyMBull/Python-Pen-Testing-Tools/blob/main/Python%20PenTesting%20Tools/Ransomeware.py" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>.

What is "Key Stretching"? Key stretching allows us to create longer & more complex crypto keys of a smaller size. This makes the crypto key much harder to deduce via cipher text analysis attacks, as well as allow max computational performance. Typically the larger the key, the longer it takes to encrypt/decrypt. We’re also going to add in the main os/os.sys modules to send shell code commands to the main system, as well as create any directories and pivot the system for enumeration. </p> <p></p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br></br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/WhatIsRansomeWare" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

It's such an exact copy that you literally cannot tell the difference. The only difference you'll notice is that your "sessions" don't seem to quite be there. What do I mean by that? Ever opened a browser in private mode and realized you had to log back into all of your stuff? That's what I'm talking about, except it doesn't have the little incognito icon or any indicators you are used to seeing that would give it away, or at least NOT anymore. If the attacker is smart, then they can locate where cookies and saved data are stored onto the system, and then integrate it into this, BUT, that would defeat the purpose of having you re-enter them in again manually so they can exploit you. </p> <p></p> <p>Even still this form of exploit will trick you just the same. It even has the exact settings and pages, and features as the original, because it IS the original, technically. This allows you to steal credentials and other forms of sensitive information such as cookies for example from end user browser sessions. </p> <p></p> <p>The most dangerous part about this exploit is that:</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 One, it's custom and can go beyond the typical scope of just phishing data from unsuspecting end users, and </p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Two, it takes advantage of the fact you ALWAYS, have your browser open and that you are constantly clicking away at those little keystrokes of yours. This means you can get two for one and install all sorts of malware, run background processes, and even install a keylogger on the system and send data to a remote server you have to log end user credentials. It can get even more scary if you can replicate a screen watch feature in the meterpreter shell to watch the end users screen as they type. This allows you to bypass stuff like MFA, where you can see the EXACT token information being sent. </p> <p></p> <p>For this project you are going to need something that is known as a "chromium" driver, since we are going to be working with Google Chrome for this exploit. This driver, along with the selenium module has come A LONG WAY. It originally ONLY displayed the chromium browser which was a dead give away, but now, it displays the REAL thing, so there is nothing that gives it away if you manage to spoof the chrome signature and place it on the end user system.</p> <p></p> <p>Link to <a href = "https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads" style = "text-decoration: none;">Chromium Driver</a> </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "chromium" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a Chromium Driver? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The Chromium driver is what we are going to be using to mimic the chrome browser that is installed on your system, along with a module in python that is called "selenium", which allows you to call up a series of web drivers: chrome, Firefox, etc etc, and launch the real thing, even with a default page. It’s most commonly used for web application development across all resolutions for all browsers.</p> <p></p> <p>This is combined with Selenium which is a module in python that allows you to develop test case scenarios for browser integration, for stuff like add on's and extensions, or, if you are the devs, it allows you to test for new in house main features before they are added to the browser. </p> <p></p> <p>In the right hand’s, it’s harmless, BUT, in the right hands it can do a lot of damage. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "physical" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a Physical Hack? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A physical hack is a scenario where the attacker has physical access to the system, and can perform stuff like: inserting a keylogger dongle into systems to log end user keystrokes, installing back-doors and malware, taking advantage of admin access and other trusted systems and services on the network to “live off the land”, as well as bypass security further by disabling firewall systems that might block backdoor access so the attacker can maintain access, which can allow them to further do stuff like: excavate data off the network, further extend their level of access to various other sub-networks and sub domains that might belong to the infrastructure, all while being able to go undetected.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "connection" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is  the connection between a Physical hack and Social Engineering? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Social engineering allows you to manipulate people and gain access to the system physically, followed up by a physical hack that allows you to physically gain and maintain access This sets you up to potentially have backdoor access that allows you to tap back into the system undetected and exploit the system as you see fit. This allows you to bypass stuff that you normally wouldn’t be able to if it were only from a digital landscape. Some things can only be done physically due to the level of complexities that might be in place for a system infrastructure.</p> <p></p> <p>This is a common tactic that is used , whether it be as a pen-tester that is testing the security in an infrastructure, or as a threat actor that is trying to leverage the system for their own personal gain. They go hand in hand.</p> </br></br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/ManInTheBrowserExploit" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

This keeps it out of the sight of the law enforcement and viewable only to the specific audience that he caters it to.</p> <p></p> <p>In order for one to maintain anonymity when hosting a [.]Onion server on the dark web it is CRUCIAL for it to be hosted on one's own PRIVATE servers, NOT a public domain, where it can easily be found and compromised. </p> <p></p> <p>The URL link to access the site needs to also be "VIP", where it's essentially hidden in areas of the deep web, while also being given to a select few via various means: WhatsApp, Telegram, hidden Wiki Pages, etc.</p> <p></p> <p>The reason the pages need to be hidden is so that it stays off the ranges of the law enforcement, A.K.A the FBI, which typically is responsible for seizing and shutting down illegal operations on the dark web.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "privateserver" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How to Host a PRIVATE web Server? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>In order to host your own [.]Onion server you need to understand what port forwarding is. This is crucial and is how Ron was able to host his own TOR servers private on his internal network. Let's dive into what port forwarding is.</p> <p></p> <p>Port forwarding allows you to map internal IP's/ports on a network to an external gateway interface, your router. Here's how the process works. You essentially map an internal IP address and port number from a local system on your network to one of the available ports on your router, so that it's facing the internet. This is going to map the service to the public IP address assigned to the router via the ISP, as well as the port we just set for it. This allows the service to be discoverable by internal and external network devices, meaning if you wanted to host your own website from the comfort of your own home, you could, as well as a variety of different services. Be mindful when you set this, the ports don't have to be the same, meaning you can mismatch them if you want to.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "majorflaw" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">TOR's Major Flaw and how a Ron got hacked? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>So the biggest question is, how was Elliot able to bypass Tor's security and hack Ron’s TOR server if they were truly anonymous? Well, the answer is quite simple, he wasn’t. Ron was only anonymous when his internal network traffic became external and was routed through TOR's Onion servers, allowing him to change his public IP and proxy it to host it more securely and anonymously. This means that even if the FBI did manage to find the server, the his true identity would be truly anonymous and protected, more so if they didn't leave behind sensitive information about those that were involved with the site. This would also allow him to discard server data should he be compromised.</p> <p></p> <p>The problem with this is TOR only works when it's able to leave the internal network and communicate with TOR's onion servers. Any and all traffic that hasn't left the network yet is fully exposed and can be intercepted if someone breaches the internal network, which allows stuff like DNS spoofing and parsing techniques that can strip secure network traffic and handle it on behalf of the real DNS server itself, forwarding it as if it were never intercepted. </p> <p></p> <p>This also allows an attacker to bypass any form of segmentation that the main access point might have set in place on the local network. This is crucial in that it allowed Elliot to find the server on the local network regardless of whether or Ron might have had proper segmentation and routing configurations in place.</p> <p></p> <p>Regardless of how segmentation on the network is configured, any and ALL network traffic eventually has to talk to the final endpoint node on the network, the default gateway router. Because of this, Elliot was able to intercept the traffic and bypass the TOR onion protocol and locate, as well as excavate any and all sensitive data from the servers and put in an anonymous tip with the law enforcement to have Ron arrested with solid evidence to shut him down for good.</p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/BypassingTor" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

Well it depends on the type of Wireless security you are trying to crack. In this case since it’s WPA2, the end goal is to intercept the main handshake that occurs between the host and access point when it connects to the network.</p> <p></p> <p>Now you might be wondering, how do you get that information if host systems are already connected to AP? The handshake is complete so there’s no way to get that information right? Wait for them to reconnect? Why wait when you can just force them. What you essentially need to do in order to bypass the security, is “de-authenticate” them from the network, forcing them to reconnect.</p> <p></p> <p>In order to do this you need to tell the AP directly to de-authenticate them since it’s impossible to talk to the specific hosts on the network when you don’t have access to it.Think of the WAP as an HTTP web application server you can send requests and various HTTP headers to, to invoke various responses. In this process we are essentially doing the same thing, sending the right data packets in order to kick end users off the main access point and scan for the handshake in the process. All you NEED, is the right NIC card to perform passive recon for data packets.</p> <p></p> <p>The first step is to use airmon-ng in order to place your main NIC card into something that is called “monitor mode”. Monitor mode allows your NIC card to perform passive recon and sniff out any WAP’s, as well as host systems connected to them. It can also be used to check and kill any processes that might interfere with the scan such as the NetworkManager service for example. The next step is to use the airodump-ng command in order to scan RF channels to search for the SSID of the network AP you wish to target.</p> <p></p> <p>Once found, you can hone in on the AP and see any and all main systems that are connected to it as well, including any MAC addresses that could possibly allow you to bypass stuff like MAC filters that require you to have a trusted MAC address in order to connect to the network.</p> <p></p> <p>Next thing you want to do, while scanning the main AP with airodump-ng is pop open another shell session and then use the aireplay-ng command in order to send authentication packets to force end users to reconnect in order to secure the handshake. THIS PROCESS DOES TAKE TIME.</p> <p></p> <p>Now the question is, how to defend against this. Nowadays, AP’s are essentially “randomizing” the frequency channel to prevent people from scanning the access point.If you can’t scan it, then you can’t see the hosts that are on the network, as well as secure the main handshake. It’s something so simple that can stop hackers in their tracks.</p> </br></br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wifi-hacking-aircrack-ng-roy-bull-futaba-webs--bydbf/?trackingId=Zc1WbkyUSkampmjlJqWKuw%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

Revolutionary, as it plays a vital role in how a computing system works on a binary level, using either a compiler or interpreter on behalf of a human readable programming language, to convert human readable instructions into code that a machine can understand. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "cobol" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">COBOL, the first HUMAN programming language, was invented by a WOMAN 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Yes, you heard that right ladies and gentlemen, the first modern human readable programming language that involved converting human words into machine code was made by a woman, specifically, “Grace Hopper”.

Well for starters, any and all tools, whether it be for offense or defense, have already been built from the ground up for you by skilled PROGRAMMERS. This means that stuff like: splunk, SOAR, SIEM, NMAP, Metasploit, etc, stuff that makes your job a lot easier, and automated, rely on very skilled programmers to develop them. </p> <p></p> <p>This also applies to large scale security systems and vendors set in place that allow infrastructures to easily install and set up security systems seamlessly. This allows businesses that might not have the best knowledge and skill set for required security compliance to meet any and all needs to have a secure infrastructure. Take programming away and we loose all of that.</p> <p></p> <p>If programming were to become extinct, then the new usage of tools to fight Cyber Security threats becomes null and void. You’d have to build them from the ground up which would require EVERYONE to know programming. The only reason it’s becoming less required is because there already exist teams that focus on that for you, like Security Engineers for example.</p> <p></p> <p>What is a Security Engineer? Well, as the name would suggest, they help design and implement various security measures within software and system infrastructures. They also implement secure coding practices in order to patch any and all vulnerabilities that might exist in software, as well as implement new measures for ongoing projects. They play a CRUCIAL role in the overall landscape of security threats. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "updates" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">There would be no Security Updates/Fixes 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>If you take away programming from Cyber Security, then who is supposed to patch and implement version control and new security fixes each time there is a major breach? I’m waiting………??? HELLOOOO????</p> <p></p> <p>This makes sense as the overall process for FDE is to enumerate THE ENTIRE file system ENTIRELY and encrypt EVERY single file on the system. Asymmetric would be too slow for this as it's a slower encryption standard. It's also commonly used in mobile device data encryption as well for the same reasons.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "tools" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">You can build your own tools! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I think one of the biggest advantages to being able to program is that you can design your own custom tools. All the stuff I’ve shown you so far from previous articles are all custom made by me. I have fine tune control of what I need my tools to do. </p> <p></p> <p>Programming your own tools also allows you to bypass security systems via obfuscation and evolve them if you are on the more offensive side of things. </p> <h4 id = "critically" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Programming teaches you how to critically think 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Programming teaches you how to think more logically and TRULY understand what goes on under the hood behind the tools that you use on a regular basis, making you more effective with them. There’s a difference between using a port scanner, and understanding what a port scanner is. Most know how to use the tool, but many don’t understand it. Another analogy for this is people that know how to use a computer but have ZERO technical skills with one.

    document.getElementById('testq').innerHTML = `<div class="modal-body" style = "text-align: left; font-weight: normal;"> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Women_Cyber" src = "Images/TheEvilTwinAttack.jpg" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo;""> </h3> </br></br> <h4 id = "premise" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Premise 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Typically this is done using something that is known as “WiFi Pineapple” from Hack5. The tool is designed to masquerade as a legitimate network access point and trick end users into connecting, posing as the router and intercepting any and all exit node traffic data that is sent to it, stripping it in the process to bypass secure communication methods. It interconnects with the main access point in the process and forwards the communication on its behalf to your target destination as if nothing ever happened. </p> <p></p> <p>But, WE'RE much better than that. You shouldn't have to rely on someone else’s tool to get the job done. Are you a hacker or aren't you? I'm going to show you HOW to perform the exploit without one and the raw natural science behind it. </p> <p></p> <p>HOWEVER, since this involves WIFI hacking and network penetration testing, I recommend you check out my previous article that covers more on this topic as it goes over a lot of terminology that you might be unfamiliar with. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "rogue" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a Rogue Access Point? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Rogue access points are wireless access points that masquerade as an original access point in order to trick end users into connecting to them, or as access points that one would assume is safe to access. Once the victim connects it, simulates that of a REAL network, gateway portal and all (the login page you see when you connect to free WiFi). Once the end user is on the network they will start to use it and try to access websites that they would typically use, some requiring them to login and send over sensitive credentials. This also includes any and all forms of MFA data that is sent over as well, allowing hackers to bypass their security. What happens next involves a process known as DNS poisoning.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "dns" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is DNS Poisoning? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>DNS Poisoning is similar to a technique known as ARP poisoning, where you poison the ARP cache of a network or switch gateway device in order to receives copies of what other systems on the network are sending to and from the network. </p> <p></p> <p>To put it simply with a example that is easy to understand, you’re spoofing the end user MAC/IP addresses on the network OR, directly targeting the ARP cache of the gateway device to intercept their traffic, which in return will lead to you also receiving a copy of what the target system receives as they send data over the network. This will lead to you being able to capture stuff like sensitive credentials, even bypassing secure communications like HTTPS since you can’t spy on that through normal means using stuff like wireshark or TCPdump. If you try to do so you will get nothing. </p> <p></p> <p>HOWEVER, in this case we are spoofing and manipulating the DNS routing that is set in place in order to redirect the end user to malicious sites of our choosing. DNS occurs on port 53 and is what the default gateway uses in order to handle and route network traffic on your behalf while browsing the internet. This is handy in case you happen to misspell something when entering in a site name. It also handles stuff like converting name based IP addresses back to their respective numeral format so that you can browse the internet with ease. </p> <p></p> <p>What we are going to do in this case, for demonstration purposes, is setup a rogue access point that will have a system on the network “acting” like the default gateway. Once the end user connects to it, we are going to have them routed to it, and then spoof sites like google via the host configuration file to route the end user on our behalf to the apache server that will contain a spoofed server usingHTTPRACKwhen they try to visit it. The goal of the attack is to have it log down any sensitive credentials that are sent from the client, which we will check via the apache logs via the configuration file located here/var/log/apache2/access.log</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "disconnect" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">I just won’t connect to any AP’s that aren’t mine! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Here’s where you’re wrong about that and how you can still get hacked. Remember the last article where I talked about how the whole process of breaching a wireless access point involved sending de-authentication packets? We do this in order to bounce systems off the network and force them to re-authenticate in order to secure the 4 way handshakes for WPA2 wireless encryption. This can also be applied here to kick you off your own network and pop you onto the rogue one. </p> <p></p> <p>When you connect to an access point in general your system looks for the SSID to connect to in name based format. If an attacker creates one of the same name and then kicks everyone else off the main one, who do you think it will prioritize? This can also be done via Jamming methods, combining the de-authentication method I’ve just discussed so far. It's because of this that Evil Twin attackers are able to bypass randomized AP channel security that is often seen on AP devices.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "jamming" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What are Jamming Attacks? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Jamming attacks jam the signal of the original access point so that victims on the network can only connect to yours when they attempt to re-authenticate back to the main AP. It causes a form of RF interference that prevents the main AP from allowing end users to connect back to it. Think of this like a form of DOS, where you block the router, in this case, so that only your AP can be interacted with if that makes sense.</p> <p></p> <p>This process is done exploiting something that is known as a “Transmit Power Level” (PWR) that is set in order to change the overall quality of the RF frequency that emits electromagnetic signals that transmit wireless data from one end point to another via a data channel line. It has an integer value, where the lower the number the better the quality. Find one that is of better quality or a match and you'll be able to jam the AP if yours is better. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "rogue" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How to spot that you are on one 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the biggest dead giveaways to knowing that you are on a rogue access point is the classic lack of HTTP for sites that typically have them. If you ever notice that your network traffic doesn’t appear to be “secure” for sites that typically have HTTPS and such for them then you know that you are on one. </p> <p></p> <p>Be mindful just because a site has “HTTPS” doesn't mean it’s secure either if you were browsing from a legitimate access point. These are just key things to look out for if you are in these particular situations. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "bypass" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Evil Twin Attacks Bypass Random AP Channel Security 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Before we dive into what Ransomware is, let's go over what FDE is, since it heavily applies to the topic for today.</p> <p></p> <p>FDE, full disk encryption, is a defensive technique that is used to harden data protection across all hierarchical flat file systems. It's the overall process of enumerating the entire file system, and then applying what is known as symmetric cryptography in order to encrypt the entire data storage medium. A good example of this would be bitlocker, which is commonly used for Windows system infrastructures.</p> <p></p> <p>As you know, data encryption is irreversible without the crypto keys, so by performing this method and leaving the keys out the hands of the attacker, should they breach the system, whether it be digitally or physically, any and all data they steal will be useless to them.</p> <h4 id = "hypothetically">How to Hypothetically bypass randomized channels without Evil Twin? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>It’s quite simple, there are only a finite number of channels that we can send de-authenticate packets to, so if we wanted to, hypothetically, we can also randomize using the Aircrack-ng tool via a bash script that will randomize our channels as well so that we will eventually hit the AP. All we need is ONE of them to connect and the exploit will be successful. </p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "exploit" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Exploit 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>For this exploit, all you are going to need are two access points with different qualities in PA levels, one weaker than the other in order to kick the end user off the network. You can use whatever you want, BUT, in case you want a easy setup I recommend this product right here. You'll also need the NIC card that is listed here as well if you want to kick them off the network via de-authentication packets.</p> <p></p> <p><a href = "https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-SDWS4-016G-G46-Sandisk-Connect-16GB/dp/B00ZCFYDLA/ref=asc_df_B00ZCFYDLA/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=385197824350&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12478942917798341849&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9067609&hvtargid=pla-479466799164&psc=1&mcid=db642fbea31d3800972b9f377fac9ab2&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=76690811457&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=385197824350&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12478942917798341849&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9067609&hvtargid=pla-479466799164&gclid=CjwKCAiAi6uvBhADEiwAWiyRds9gIRl1_TzjEcLdE-Cj83t7nie6QbKjCTqVZOHsFO_200NVV2kDWBoCr7cQAvD_BwE" style = "text-decoration: none;">SanDisk Wireless Flash Drive</a> </p> <p></p> <p><a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Alfa-Long-Range-Dual-Band-Wireless-External/dp/B00VEEBOPG/ref=asc_df_B00VEEBOPG/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=309777534894&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=661451366676614644&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9067609&hvtargid=pla-406165012713&psc=1&mcid=77bc9198dfae3589b73068333f6e0b4e&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=58425267301&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=309777534894&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=661451366676614644&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9067609&hvtargid=pla-406165012713&gclid=Cj0KCQiArrCvBhCNARIsAOkAGcUeiotTlpUEhgZHW53hz7zd008q-HYczYEUYfkTd-nMqiswJxSsrcYaAlqOEALw_wcB" style = "text-decoration: none;">AlfaAC1200</a></p> <p></p> <p>This little toy here, the SanDisk Wireless Flash drive is one of the best “unintended” hacking tools that you could possibly own.

The default gateway also has all HTTP methods allowed so you can practice hacking them, that, and it also allows you to daisy chain to a main AP just like the WiFi pineapple. It also happens to have a weaker PA level that we can exploit. That, and unlike most AP’s today, you can practice WIFI hacking against it since it doesn't have randomized channels for security. </p> <p></p> <p></p> </br> </br> <p>Now, the exploit:</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 First, set the SSID of the SanDisk AP to anyone that you desire. You can do this for the gateway portal where all the configurations are located.</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Next, add systems to the network and then have them connect to the target AP gateway portal of the system to check if you are on the right network. If they can talk to the portal then you are good to go. </p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Next, pop open a router that you have and change its SSID to that of the SanDisk one, and then, and this is also CRUCIAL, set the password for the Access point to NONE. You need to do this so that the end users are automatically authenticated to the AP. This creates the illusion they are re-authenticating, allowing you to go undetected. </p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Next, pop open my video that I’ve provided and follow along up until “2:50”, which is where you will see the main AP of the Sandisk Flash drive being de-athenticated. This also shows you how to setup the NIC to sniff AP's Follow those very steps to kick end users off the network, and watch as they bounce to the rogue one that you’ve created. Once that’s done check if you have clients on the rogue network. If they are, then the exploit was a success!</p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/TheEvilTwinAttack" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

Any and all code is well commented and documented, so you should have no trouble understanding what each line does. </p> <p></p> <p><a href = "https://github.com/RoyMBull/Python-Pen-Testing-Tools" style = "text-decoration: none;">My GitHub</a></p> <p></p> <h4 id = "malware" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Malware? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Malware is any form of program that is designed for malicious reasons to infect and harm a system. It can come in many types and affect the system in various ways.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "poly" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Polymorphic Virus 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Polymorphic viruses have the ability to mask their own code by means of encryption. This is a form of obfuscation technique that can also be used in order to avoid detection from various security systems, which can also allow the malware to command and control via communication with the bot master SECURELY. </p> <p></p> <p>As you know, computer systems, much like a human, are UNABLE to decipher data encryption. It comes up as garble to them. This allows the malware to remain invisible and not trigger any flags set by security systems.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "armored" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Armored Virus 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Armored malware focuses on defensive measures that make it hard to remove. A good example of this would be boot infector rootkits, that embeds itself in the master boot records of the system, proving to be fatal if you try to remove them.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "retro" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Retrovirus 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Retroviruses are designed to neutralize any form of antivirus system set in place. They are the anti-virus for anti-virus. If you shut off any form of security system in place you basically CREATE a zero day where EVERYTHING goes undetected. </p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "phage" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Phage Virus 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Phage Viruses, also known as “worm” viruses, are standalone viruses that can operate independent of the person who wrote it.

Companion malware is designed to pose as legitimate software on the system, tricking the end user into executing it to compromise their system. It can be stuff like: RAT(Remote Access Trojan), MITB(Man-In-The-Browser), etc. This is a common form of malware that is even used in phishing tactics CONSISTENTLY. </p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "crypto" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Crypto-Malware 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This is Ransomware. It’s any form of malware that utilizes data encryption in order to compromise a system by enumerating the disk partitions and applying encryption at rest in order to render end user data infeasible, requiring them to pay a ransom in order to restore their data.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "hybrid" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Hybrid Virus 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Hybrid malware, another common form of malware, focuses on combining several characteristic traits from other forms of malware.</p> <p></p> <p>This can be deadly, for example, if it were a worm virus that acts on it’s own and can encrypt and protect itself, as well as re-write it’s own code.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "meramorphic" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Meramorphic Virus 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the HARDEST forms of malware to write, but EXTREMELY POWERFUL, this form of malware is able to re-write its own code, allowing it to adapt when needed. Think of this form of malware like “Darwinism”</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "cavity" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Cavity Virus 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This is any form of malware that uses steganography tactics, which is commonly seen in Trojan malware. Steganography is the art of masking other data within other forms of data. </p> <p></p> <p>Here is a sample snippet of code, which you can copy and paste into a bash file and test out if you would like</p> <p></p> <p>The script can be found <a href = "https://github.com/RoyMBull/Bash-Shell-Scripting/blob/main/Bash%20Shell%20Scripting/Steganography.sh" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a> in my bash repo</p> <p></p> <p>If you try to unzip this file on it's own while it's encoded, you’ll notice that it doesn't work and it is registered as a “TEXT/ASCII” file type.

The tool is so seamless and easy to use that even people that don’t understand anything about hacking could pull it off, hence its ban being set into motion. But… What if I told you it’s pointless to ban it? </p> <p></p> <p>I want to talk about why it’s pointless to ban the Flipper Zero, as well as some basic things that could be done to prevent motor vehicle car theft with it, as well as other methods similar to it.</p> <p></p> <p>I also want to talk about how Cyber Security is a game of chess, and how it is meant to be played to deter Cyber threats. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "flipperzero" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the Flipper Zero? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The Flipper Zero Tamagotchi is a multi functioning tool that is able to intercept, clone, and replay various data communication methods specifically tailored to Radio/RF and RFID/NFC. This allows it to clone any form of authentication credentials that might pertain to the end user, allowing a threat actor to bypass security and access the system.</p> <p></p> <p>In simpler terms, it’s able to clone the unique signature and data that is exchanged via remote control, such as a automobile car remote that unlocks the car door for you, or via RFID/NFC device tap, which exchanges data when you tap things like your ID badge to access a control room for example. It can even be simpler things like the NFC chips that are installed on our debit/credit cards, or our phones when we “tap” it to make purchases on a regular basis or access various facilities like storage units. An attacker could use this to: break into your car, purchase things on your behalf, access control systems and authenticate as if they were you, and a lot more. The list goes on!</p> <p></p> <p>This technique is also what is known as a Replay Attack, which is commonly used to intercept crypto keys in order to perform a Wrapping Attack that allows an attacker to man in the middle and change the overall contents of the data that is being exchanged as if they were the original sender, while using the key to peek and do so each time.</p> <p></p> <p>If you ban the Flipper Zero then you have to ban every hacking tool that exists</p> <p></p> <p>There are a ton of hacking tools on the market, even ones from <a href = "https://shop.hak5.org/" style = "text-decoration: none;">Hack5</a> that also can do what the Flipper Zero does. To ban the Flipper Zero, means to ban all these tools as well. </p> <p></p> <p>Take For example the HackRF One which can also analyze RF frequencies for various purposes like the Flipper Zero and imitate them. It’s been around long before the Flipper Zero was ever made and it has yet to be banned. The only difference between the two, is that one is more accessible than the other. If that’s the case, then we need to upgrade our security so silly stuff like this DOESN’T happen. Rule of thumb, IF A SCRIPT KIDDIE CAN PWN IT, IT’S A PROBLEM!</p> <p></p> <p>Besides, it’s easy to make your own Flipper Zero if you're skilled enough to do so. You can even name it whatever you want and bypass the ban. The Flipper Zero isn’t anything we haven’t seen before, it’s just cute and popular!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "lackofsecurity" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">It’s not the Flipper Zero, It’s our lack of Security 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The problem isn't the Flipper Zero, it’s our lack of proper understanding of security practices that can be used to effectively neutralize the threat.</p> <p></p> <p>It’s no shocker that the implementation of Cyber Security practices are just now becoming a standard, with legal aspects cracking down HARD and punishing infrastructures for not implementing it, via fines and other means. This is because we are moving closer and closer to a more digital landscape where everything is connected, which is good news for hackers, since it extends the scope and range of what they can target now more than ever.</p> <p></p> <p>Security has been one of the many things ignored for far too long. It’s the main reason why we have so many security breaches. Most systems, even basic stuff like web applications, don’t factor security in terms of overall design. It’s our job to ensure that anything and everything is properly secured regardless of what format said technology comes from. This also includes automobiles, which is the main topic for today since it relates to the Flipper Zero Tamagotchi.</p> <p></p> <p>The problem now is that we are just now catching up, while hackers have already done their homework and pretty much can stay ahead of the game. We need to do the same!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "chess" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Cyber Security Is A Game of Chess 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Cyber Security is a game of chess. What do I mean by that? I think the best example would be the classic one I provide a lot in my articles, my CTF server, <a href = "https://github.com/RoyMBull/Futabas_Playground" style = "text-decoration: none;">“Futaba’s Playground”</a>.</p> <p></p> <p>When I made the CTF server I basically had to “play this game of chess”, where I had to think several steps ahead of the player as they progressed throughout the game as if they were a “real” adversary. I had to think of all the possible variables of what the player could do to bypass my security and cheat the game.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, I ran into an issue where the player could easily access critical files on the server that would allow them to capture flags in unintended ways. This could easily be done via the browser, as well as ssh shells which are intended for the player to progress. This is a HUGE no go, so I needed to put a stop to that pronto. </p> <p></p> <p>My thought process to upgrade security was to figure out how to block easy web application access to the files, while also blocking ssh system command access to the files, and on top of this, I needed to make sure the server account hosting the web application could still read the files, while also ensuring the player could progress. Still with me? I know, this was a major headache for me too and took a lot of trial and error until I got it right!</p> <p></p> <p>The remedy for this was to: set the files on the server to ownership of the main account that reads it, that way only it and root users can access it. Root access can only be done on the final stage of the game, so by the time the player manages to get to all the files it will already be too late. See what I did there? I did a lot more, but of course, NO SPOILERS!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "prevent" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How to prevent automobile theft via the Flipper Zero (IN THEORY) 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>In theory, and it’s quite simple, the best way to prevent automobile theft with the Flipper Zero is to implement the same methods that prevent Replay Attacks in general: splitting the data channels so that authenticated credentials to unlock the motor vehicle are not sent alongside each other. You can even layer frequency randomization on top of that much like with wireless access points to throw the tool off, that way it misses its target. These little things can hurt the effectiveness of the tool greatly.</p> <p></p> <p>I don’t specialize in motor vehicle security, but I’m pretty sure there are a ton of other methods that can prevent the Flipper Zero from hacking into car systems. We just need to implement the security in place to do so!</p> <p></p> <p>If you have any other ideas that could improve motor vehicle security, feel free to drop your thoughts bellow in the comment section. I’d love to hear your own thoughts on the matter? </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/Totsugeki" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

This also leads to a lot of people taking a lot of shortcuts that set them back in the long run, making them underprepared to enter the field. </p> <p></p> <p>Regardless of what side you are on: red team, blue team, purple team, or the type of technology you help secure, you NEED to have a deep understanding of it if you truly wish to secure it. </p> <p></p> <p>If you are a red teamer, you need to understand how various core technologies work in order to exploit them. This allows you to find critical flaws in the system you are testing against so it can be properly secured. How can you exploit something when you don’t understand how it works? Yes there are tons of tools, SQLmap for example, that can help red teamers pinpoint SQL injection vulnerabilities, but you still need to understand how SQL injection works on a fundamental level to use it properly. The tool is only as good as your fundamental understanding of the vulnerability it was designed to exploit. Not understanding how to find this type of vulnerability, even with the tool could cause you to miss critical vulnerabilities that did in fact exist, which can cause A LOT OF real world damage to an infrastructure if left unchecked.</p> <p></p> <p>If you are a blue teamer, you need to understand how core technologies work on a fundamental level so you can properly secure them. How can you secure something when you don’t understand how it works? Take the CTF server I made for example, <a href = "https://github.com/RoyMBull/Futabas_Playground" style = "text-decoration: none;">"Futaba's Playground"</a>. It requires me to understand proper secure coding principles, as well as Linux system administration and configurations in order to properly secure the server. This prevents the player from bypassing any security for any and all challenges in unintended ways. I secured the server as if it were a real system from real threats, YOU, the player. If I wanted to take it a step further I can combine it with already pre-made tools and frameworks like SIEM and SOAR for example, that upgrade and smoothen the process for me depending on what I need it for. See where I’m going with this? </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "programming"style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">YoU DoNt NeEd PrOgRAmMiNg FoR cYBeR sEcUrItY 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I wrote an article a while back on why programming is crucial for Cyber Security. You can check that out <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-programming-import-cyber-security-roy-bull-futaba-webs--sm80e/?trackingId=1l%2BRV%2FzwQUatieczffa%2Fig%3D%3D&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BVEzx1nN%2FR3S024KklIANNg%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a> if you would like to. For now, I’m going to talk a bit about forensics, one of the main fields in Cyber that people want to get into but REFUSE to learn how to code for. A lot of this is due to what I mentioned earlier, about people being sold the false notion they don’t need to be technical to work in Cyber. You do need to be technical if you want to get into forensics. Forensics is crucial in that it stops the spread of malware should it pose a real worldwide threat. </p> <p></p> <p>Forensics, most of which involves a lot of reverse engineering and malware analysis, does in fact require you to know how to code, as well as be able to read it regardless of what programming language it might be in. Does it require you to understand how to program in every language and framework under the sun? No! But you do need to understand how code works, as well as the technology behind it under the hood. This also requires in depth technical knowledge about stuff like a debugger which allows you to trace binary code flow. </p> <p></p> <p>You need to understand how to write code so that you can replicate and/ or tamper with strains of malware you find. This allows you to cross test and find mitigations to secure against future malware infections. </p> <p></p> <p>You need to understand how to read code, regardless of whether or not it might be a language you’re familiar with in order to dissect it. Sure, stick to malware in languages that you are familiar with, but often in the realm of Cyber Security, hackers are creative, and you’ll often find unicorn-like malware or techniques that you didn’t know about. You need to be able to adapt, and interpret it. Reading code is hard due to the nature of how sloppy and undocumented most code is written. You need to get comfortable with that and understand how to read and follow along core programming logic to understand how malware works. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "networking"style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Networking and Building your brand 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>BUILD YOUR BRAND! BUILD YOUR BRAAANNND! I Can’t stress this enough. The market for Cyber Security is HIGHLY competitive right now. You need to stand out. Even if you are a skilled professional, people need to know who you are. Remember, it’s not about what you know (even though it is in Cyber), it’s about WHO, you know. Even if you are a skilled professional, if no one is able to see what you can do, and it’s not interactive then NOBODY CARES!!! Get used to that. Would you hire the nobody, or the somebody that has shown what they can do? Remember, this is a HIGH paying COMPETITIVE field, where places are looking to hire the best of the best. They are investing in YOU, to secure their systems, so don’t disappoint! There are tons of skilled people, but not many that show off what they can do, and lose out to many that are unqualified due to poor marketing. All brain and no aim. </p> <p></p> <p>Take for example, my brand <a href = "https://linktr.ee/Futaba_Webs" style = "text-decoration: none;">Futaba_Webs</a>. I’ve been in the dark for a while now about my skill sets and was just mindlessly applying to jobs and hoping for the best. I wasn’t networking or marketing myself so that professionals could engage with me and see my skill sets. This HURT me a lot, especially as someone that is self taught and cannot easily afford certifications. I have a lot of skill, most of which is “abnormal” from the level I should be at professionally in case you haven’t noticed. Despite what my resume says, I’ve been in tech for YEARS, and in each role, if you read closely, I was ALWAYS involved in some form of Cyber Security in each one. </p> <p></p> <p>The results I got? Constant connections flooding in, my brand going in the right direction, being asked to provide MORE mentorship and when I'll be doing it with a program I plan to announce soon <a href = "https://www.patreon.com/Futaba_Webs" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>, as well as being on the radar of high ranking and high level well established Cyber Security professionals. The results have been insane, and the support that has followed with it has been amazing as well. I’ve also been tagged in regards to large scale conferences and asked to speak at them, one I plan to do soon. </p> <p></p> <p>Even all of my articles and tutorials have been clever strategies to help advertise and sell my brand and get people to support my work so that they feel comfortable supporting my product I plan to launch soon which people have been asking for more of. People want to support you and aid you, but you have to PROVE you are legit. GET YOUR NAME OUT THERE NOW!!!!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "selfdev"style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Say No to Self-Development 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>If you don’t like having to constantly learn and adapt, then maybe this isn’t the field for you. In case you haven’t noticed, Cyber Security is an ever evolving landscape, where threats are constantly evolving. You need to stay in the loop on new technologies and methods hackers use to breach systems. This information alone allows us to improve our overall security infrastructures and keep them safe. Refusing to adapt is like refusing to update from Windows XP to the latest firmware. You pick up what I’m putting down? </p> </br> </br></br> <h4 id = "communication"style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Communication Skills Are Over Hyped 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Trying to sell CyberSecurity products and spread security awareness? Part of the reason no one takes their security practices seriously is due to the lack of understanding of it, and how it’s explained. Notice how ALL of my articles I go into FULL detail and break technical concepts down to their simplest form, with examples that are easy to understand while still retaining their core technical aspects. Notice how this entire article I’ve essentially done the same thing, while still being technical but not TOO technical. You understand? Good! </p> <p></p> <p>You need to be mindful that not everyone is technical and some people need it to be explained to them in simpler terms.

This is to help show you the do’s and don’ts when looking for one, as well as how to maintain one should you happen to find one. Mentors, GOOD ones, are HARD to find, so if you happen to land one, MAINTAIN IT! </p> <p></p> <p>I’m also going to address the BIG dangers of free learning and why it doesn't work for everyone. This will better establish the main reason why people still seek mentorship even though they can learn for FREE at NO COST on their own.</p> <p></p> <p>This article is made specially after the announcement of a hybrid mentorship program that I’m working on that will be available soon! You can check out the details on my linktree <a href = "https://linktr.ee/Futaba_Webs" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a> if you would like! MORE COMING SOON FOR IT! </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "mentor" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The role of a Cyber Security Mentors 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Cyber Security mentors are the people with experience that lead and guide the next wave of people that are seeking to enter the field. They are your teachers, and like all teachers, are CRUCIAL in order to build up your repertoire of knowledge needed to succeed in your field. They help guide you through all the stuff you need to know and filter out the stuff you don’t need to know. They also help you figure out your main interest, and narrow the skill sets you need to learn in order to succeed. They also help you develop the proper critical thinking skills that are needed to succeed in your field as well. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "part1" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Why is finding a mentor so hard? (Part 1) 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the biggest reasons why it’s hard to find a mentor is due to the shady intentions that come from most people in the Cyber Security field. It’s not news by now that a lot of people in Cyber are just looking to sell you false hopes and dreams, empty promises that are just a mere cash grab. LEARN CYBER SECURITY IN 24 WEEKS AND MASTER— You pick up what I’m putting down right?</p> <p></p> <p>Not everyone has the best intentions for you, and some, quite frankly… even those that have been in the field for years with a shiny title… Don’t know their stuff and THEY are the ones that are holding the high level certs and positions.</p> <p></p> <p>You need to also be mindful, THERE IS A LOT OF GATEKEEPING in this field. People are willing to lead others down the wrong path if it means they keep you out and or get in. If you’re looking for a mentor, make sure you check their credibility and look into them before you check in for services with them. I recommend looking for mentors that are SHOWING you what they know vs ones that HIDE all of their stuff. YouTube content creators like Rana Khali, who now runs her own academy is a classic example of someone that has established solid credibility and trust that you can look into if you need mentorship. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "part2" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Why is finding a mentor so hard? (Part 2) 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Much like how not all mentors have the best of intentions, the same can also be said for mentees. </p> <p></p> <p>Mentees, for those that do not know, have been known to take advantage of their mentors, especially the free ones who are commonly sought after. A lot of this is due to a sense of entitlement and them using any means to get in, even if they have to exploit their fellow learners and mentors in the process. Not everyone is looking to win with you so you need to be mindful of that!</p> <p></p> <p>A lot of people, and I’m sorry to even have to say this, belittle mentors, specifically ones that help for free. Some even ghost their mentors after they help them land a job. It’s these very critical reasons why free mentors are stepping away, most charging you now for their time. People don't want to be taken advantage of. </p> <p></p> <p>This also explains the main reason why people aren’t very “friendly” when you DM them and ask them for tips and tricks, and why if you do get a “free” answer, it's rather vague.</p> <p></p> <p>For me personally, it is the main reason why I have rejected EVERY SINGLE person that has asked for free mentorship thus far. All it takes is for ONE bad cookie, and it has a rippling effect. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "mentorable" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Are you Mentorable? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Most people sadly aren’t mentorable. More times than none, as someone that mentors consistently, PEOPLE DO NOT LISTEN TO THEIR MENTORS! If you are going to seek mentorship LISTEN TO THE PROFESSIONALS advice, especially if it comes from one that is highly credible.</p> <p></p> <p>People are looking for shortcuts to get in, and when they find out there aren’t any, and they have to do and learn the thing, they bail out and stop listening to their mentor, thinking they are trying to mislead them. THEY AREN’T, AND YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO THEM, otherwise you are just setting yourself back, and wasting everyone’s valuable time!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "notrecruiters" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">MENTORS ARE NOT RECRUITERS! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Mentors are NOT recruiters. It’s not their job to land you a role, that’s YOUR job, as well as the job of a recruiter. </p> <p></p> <p>People often leave their mentorships due to not securing a role, because they have the impression that their mentor is responsible for that. They don’t owe you that nor should you expect that from them, especially if they are trying to help you for free. </p> <p></p> <p>They are there to guide/teach you how Cyber Security works so that you build up the skill sets needed to succeed in this field. It’s YOUR job to decide what you do with that knowledge. No one is responsible for your success but you!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "communication" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Communication is KEY! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Keep in touch with your mentor! It’s CRUCIAL! As I’ve mentioned before, there is a lot of ghosting going around lately towards mentors that put in a lot of time to help their mentees, especially ones that do so for FREE. Respect their time and keep in touch!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "personal" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Keep your personal feelings outside of your mentorship 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I cannot stress this enough, and this also applies to the real world in general, NO ONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR PERSONAL PROBLEMS. Don’t take your personal issues out on your mentor. They are here to help you! It’s your job to stay in touch and give that bit of communication in case something does happen so they can understand. People can’t understand you if you don’t communicate! </p> <p></p> <p>RESPECT YOUR MENTORS!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "free" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Do you want FREE learning or FREE Mentorship? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A lot of people think that the thing they want is FREE learning, but it’s not, it’s free mentorship and guidance which no one owes you! </p> <p></p> <p>Teaching yourself anything from the ground up is possible, but it’s EXTREMELY HARD! There is no one to guide you or explain the stuff you need to know. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.</p> <p></p> <p>I’ve been self taught for about 11 years now and I reassure you, figuring out where I had to go for Cyber was hard. I was running around in circles trying to figure stuff out. I wasn’t able to find a Cyber mentor due to all the things that I’ve mentioned, which is why I put so much effort into it.

There are seven types: white, black, gray, green, blue, red, and purple. Each hat has an agenda and purpose and plays a HUGE role in protecting our digital landscape.</p> <p></p> <p>I'm also going to go over what a script kiddie is since there is A HUGE difference between them and one particular hat that is apart of the main category that is going to be discussed today.</p> <p></p> <p>You’ll also get more in depth as to why my head line says I am a “Gray Hat Hacker”. A lot of people, and I’ve talked with a few, have no idea what the hat’s actually stand for and why we use them. </p> <p></p> <p>It’s important, especially if you are going to be a part of hacker culture. It will come up in topics, so it’s best you know what they all stand for. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "white" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">White Hat Hackers 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>White hat hackers are basically the good guys, the Cyber Security professionals that help defend various system and business infrastructures, as well as being responsible for the very security that is implemented in them as well. Without them, there would be no form of security in any and all forms of technology, and we would all be exposed to various threats. This is why “Cyber Security” exists. If you are in Cyber Security, then by default you are a white hat hacker, unless you identify otherwise. </p> <p></p> <p>They are also penetration testers that focus on exploiting a system in order to find vulnerabilities in a system, reporting it so that the side that defends can mitigate the threat so that real threat actors are unable to take advantage of it. This is typically done in the fashion of finding the flaw in the system before someone else does. </p> <p></p> <p>This hat is split into 2 unique categories, that I’m pretty sure you might already be familiar with, red team and blue team. </p> <p></p> <p>Red teamers, are the offensive security professionals like penetration testers for example who attack to find weaknesses in the system, and report them. </p> <p></p> <p>Blue teamers, are the defenders, who specialize in the core implementation of security remedies that help protect system infrastructures, as well as being first responders to various security breaches that occur within business infrastructures. </p> <p></p> <p>Each team has their own set of specialties and roles that dive deeper into the matter of what they do, but I'll leave that for another article explaining the both of them, so you can get a better idea of where you might want to start out in Cyber Security. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "black" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Black Hat Hackers 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>These are the bad guys, legit threat actors that seek to exploit a system for personal game: money, data, fame, etc. Unlike white hat hackers who have major restrictions and limitations on what they can and can’t do when conducting an official penetration test, black hat hackers don’t have this restraint. They exploit systems in any and all various ways, which is why we have to keep evolving our mitigation tactics in order to neutralize cyber crime. They are the main reason we are in an ever ending fight to protect the digital landscape. </p> <p></p> <p>They also tend to operate on places like the dark web, providing illegal services from various means based on their skill set. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "gray" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Gray Hat Hackers 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>White hat hackers are basically the good guys, the Cyber Security professionals that help defend various system and business infrastructures, as well as being responsible for the very security that is implemented in them as well.

In case you haven't noticed, black hat hackers aren’t well received.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "green" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Green Hat Hackers 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>For those of you who are new to hacking, this would be where you currently lay.</p> <p></p> <p>Green hat Hackers are newcomers that are honing their skills. </p> </br> </br></br> <h4 id = "script" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Script Kiddies 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>NOT to be confused for a green hat, who actually knows a thing or two about hacking, script kiddies are hackers, if you could call them that, that rely on someone else's tools and techniques without proper understanding to hack people. </p> <p></p> <p>The good news about these types of hackers is they will ALWAYS be predictable and are easy to counter and neutralize. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "blue" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Blue Hat Hackers 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A common trick that a lot of people like to use in order to prevent unauthorized network breaches, is they like to hide their SSID’s which is the name of the network. This is effective in that you can hide SSID information from common means of exposure, like the GUI you use when selecting a wireless access point to communicate with.</p> <p></p> <p>The problem with this is it can easily be bypassed by the same method mentioned in option #2 of how to bypass MAC address filtering. </p> <p></p> <p>Your SSID is also broadcasted along with any and all MAC address information that is sent out in data packets. They have to be, otherwise our IoT devices would be unable to pick them up and identify them. THERE IS ALWAYS A WAY TO BYPASS ANYTHING! NOTHING IS 100 PERCENT SECURE!</p> <p></p> <p>Today’s positive bonuses will focus more on how to defend against MAC address filtering bypasses, preventing an attacker from breaching the network via this security method.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "purple" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Purple Hat Hackers 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>These hackers are basically revenge hackers, or in a sense, suicide hackers depending on the situation. </p> <p></p> <p>They can also be script kiddies and or new hackers that are taking revenge on someone else.</p> <p></p> <p>They can also be white hat hackers, or disgruntled employees that have gone rogue, which can pose a real threat especially when it’s from inside the main infrastructure. </p> <p></p> <p>This term can also be for hackers that are contractors, invited to test for security flaws within software products that have yet to be released. They are hired based on their reputational value.</p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/HackingPersona" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

I wanted to raise more awareness and teach people how to protect their digital identity! A lot of the article will be me addressing what happened, as well as remedies I gave her to protect herself.</p> <p></p> <p>This is also the start of a new series that is called the “DANGER!” series, where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities within system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, where I also talk about mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent such threats.</p> <p></p> <p>There will also be a LIVE demonstration for those of you who are subscribed to my patreon, to see how closely I can exploit mobile end devices in order to retrieve any and all sensitive data from the mobile end device! There will also be a step by step exploit guide walking you through the entire process as well, and how to gelocate someone’s phone and turn it into a GPS tracker!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "connected" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! Everything is connected 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the biggest things about technology is that EVERYTHING is connected. When isn't something going online? Even stuff like electric toothbrushes are being connected to the internet. We also have stuff like smart homes and other various means of smart technology that make our lives easier. </p> <p></p> <p>The problem with all of this is that it also makes life easier for Hackers. Everything being connected extends the main scope and attack surface for them, allowing threat actors to further exploit systems in various ways. We are in a sense creating our own colossal monolithic structure where everything is both connected and further dependent on each other, which can be lethal in VARIOUS ways! </p> <p></p> <p>What do I mean by this? Well, for starters, let’s say that a hospital system that contained a multitude of life support systems were connected online and to various networks. What would happen if a threat actor with ill intentions breached the network? </p> <p></p> <p>If an attacker were to breach it, they would essentially be able to play GOD, controlling the entire system and being able to choose whether or not actual Lives were lost. If they wanted to, they could shut down all the power systems, even the backups since a lot of this stuff seems to be connected nowadays, killing EVERYONE on life support in the process.</p> <p></p> <p>Another example, would be the woman whose mobile device I talked about was breached, allowing the attacker to control her entire mobile phone and anything she gave it access to: smart home tech, Bluetooth devices, sessions that she had on, etc. The hacker was also able to ruin her credit as a lot of her personal information and files were on the system, and they happened to gain access to that as well, even sensitive contacts and messages that were directly on her phone. One little device cost her EVERYTHING and put her and the people she cares about at risk!</p> <p></p> <p>This also gets scary because, let’s say that her phone was used to authenticate to anything within an organization that she worked for. It would lead to a massive scale breach. A lot of infrastructures are still new to solid Cyber Security practices so things like this DO happen!</p> <p></p> <p>If they wanted to spoof her and do spear phishing, like I’ve mentioned, they have access to ALL of her contacts and can pull up that information. They can even spoof her number and do all sorts of nasty stuff with it, like bypassing any and all MFA she has on the phone, allowing them to even do scary stuff like wiring themselves money out of her bank account. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "traced" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! You can be traced! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Your phone is a walking GPS locator! If your phone gets hacked YOU ARE IN DANGER!</p> <p></p> <p>One of the scariest things the woman that got hacked didn’t realize.. WAS SHE WAS NOW A WALKING GPS target for them to find anytime they needed to. This meant that anytime she was around friends or family, their address and location information, or should she even connect to their home network, COULD ALL BE TRACED AND COMPROMISED in one go. She was basically a walking botnet they could command and control all in one go. </p> <p></p> <p>For many that do not realize this, your phone is connected to a cellular network via a sim card that is attached to it, allowing it to connect to the cellular network, which provides you with a private IP address that is then converted to a PUBLIC IP address that can be used to allow you to connect to the internet from your phone. </p> <p></p> <p>This means that if an attacker wanted to, they could secure your POSSIBLE location regardless of where you are as you ALWAYS tend to have your phone on you! Hackers can exploit this and ping your every move! Even if this method is debunked it's still possible to trace you with the device via other alternatives. I ran a few tests with this. If someone were to breach your device and you were connected to a personal network, such as your home network it would also be highly possible for them to ping your location since it's connected to your home network as well. You also have to keep in mind there are apps on your phone that give your location details away since you give the permission to collect that from you depending on the application.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "hijacking" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! Session Hijacking/MFA bypassing 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Your mobile device is one of the greatest forms of session hijacking. Session hijacking is where you are able to breach a victim's system and “use” any sessions that are currently in progress on them. </p> <p></p> <p>For example, your Facebook session. If you tell Facebook to keep you logged in, it will generate a cookie that can be used to remember your session and progress, which you can pick up on even if you’ve powered the system on and off. This can be critical and fatal, since an attacker could exploit this should you leave your system unattended anytime in order to do stuff like: wire themselves money via Facebook pay, change your credentials, access sensitive conversations and pretend to be you, etc, and since this is on your mobile device they will of course have access to the various means to bypass MFA on your mobile device!</p> </br></br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DangerMobileDeviceSecurity" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

I’m also going to show you how to botnet and command and control with the burp suite proxy server and how to strip any and all network traffic on a multitude of systems using it! </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "burp" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Burp Suite Proxy Server 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The burp suite proxy server is used to intercept and analyze network traffic and handle it in various ways. It is one of the most commonly used tools when testing against OWASP vulnerabilities within web application systems. THIS IS A STAPLE TOOL THAT YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO USE!</p> <p></p> <p>It can be used either for defense or for offense. In our case, we are going to talk about how it applies to offensive capabilities.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "proxy" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Proxy mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Burp suite has a feature in it that is called Proxy mode, where you can focus the tool on intercepting various network data communication methods. </p> <p></p> <p>With this particular method, you’ll be able to boot up a dummy browser session that can be used to test and track any communications that you personally send to a web application host target. Burp suite uses selenium in order to craft a test chromium browser session. </p> <p></p> <p>Why for yourself? Well, for starters, you can use the tool to gather in depth information on all the parameters and HTTP headers that are being sent to a target. You also have the ability to manipulate them and control how the server side will respond to you. It’s how hackers tend to test various fuzzing methods that will allow them to bypass security and exploit a system.</p> <p></p> <p>You can also use this feature to analyze any and all main scripts that are on the page, and follow network traffic as it pivots within the main internal, as well as any external domains that the tool might catch. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "foxy" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Foxy Proxy Mode (Firefox extension) 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now, this isn’t an exact feature that is a part of the main burp suite tool set, BUT, Firefox has a dedicated extension that allows you to set up a main proxy server on a system in order to forward all traffic to a main proxy server you have in a listening state.</p> <p></p> <p>This means that for an attacker, if we wanted to, and if we got creative, WE CAN BOTNET USING BURP SUITE. You can sit this on your system on a network, configure the extension on any and all systems on the network as well as the proxy server itself, and then BOOM, you can strip any and all network traffic, deciphering any and all credentials you can intercept.</p> <p></p> <p>You can also get creative and configure burp suite as a main proxy server within the network settings of the system you are looking to infect. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "intruder" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Intruder Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This mode is used for brute force based attacks, where you can send network traffic from the main HTTP socket history, and then handle it to inject word list points in them to have the tool brute force against. You can even set up the tool to allow stuff like pitch force brute forcing which is used to test against login time outs to bypass brute force protection on a main system.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "repeater" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Repeater Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Remember how I said that the burp suite tool can be used to manipulate the HTTP parameters and other information that is sent in the main request from client to server?</p> <p></p> <p>This mode allows you to do just that, store, modify, and repeat until you get a desired response form the server. This is crucial in case you wish to do stuff like SQL injection or RCE, and you need to see additional information that isn't shown to you from the main GUI of the site page. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "decoder" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Decoder Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This IS YOUR BREAD AND BUTTER IF YOU ARE FUZZING. What this mode allows you to do is type and encode as you need to, as well as being able to decode in case you need it to do so as well. </p> <p></p> <p>Let's say for example, you found a critical flaw in a system that allows you to RCE a server, but it doesn't allow white spaces or certain characters. It can be tricky jumping back and forth between an online encoder to handle the process for you. You can use this tool to handle all of that for you and craft a clean exploit if you need to inject some code into the target.</p> <p></p> <p>These are some of the basic core features and how they work for now.

I want to focus more on talking about the overall design of the two methods and the BIG flaws in them.</p> <p></p> <p>This article is a part of the new Danger! Series I’m launching, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p> <p>As always, any and all advanced versions of this article with a video guide if given will be for PAID patreon members only!!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "accessibility" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Accessibility vs Convenience in Cyber Security! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the biggest challenges we face when implementing new security features in an infrastructure is accessibility vs convenience, the overall means to implement a new security method while also making it convenient to use. </p> <p></p> <p>Accessibility allows the end user to easily understand and interpret/apply the new approach to security, allowing it to be seamlessly implemented into the security infrastructure in various ways. </p> <p></p> <p>This in return would require it to be more convenient in order to make it more accessible to them. Take token based MFA for example. All it is, is a simple pin code that is sent to the end user, so that they can input it into a system and authenticate on top of pre-existing knowledge factors that are set in place by default. For the sake of convenience, we have it set up so that the end user can receive the code in a variety of different ways: mobile SMS messages, email, authenticator apps, etc etc, various means spread out to allow them to use the method, which in the process, also makes it more accessible for them.</p> <p></p> <p>Sounds harmless right? WRONG. By making the method more convenient and accessible, we in fact increase the overall attack surface, making it more convenient and accessible for hackers to have options in order to exploit the security method that we’ve introduced. Don’t believe me? Check out my <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/danger-your-mobile-devices-vulnerable-roy-bull-futaba-webs--9u54e/?trackingId=OXrHkoIFT7mk8EkVhAcJkA%3D%3D&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3B7CUpqjxKRHaRgkH5R2N%2BAA%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;">“DANGER!Your Mobile Devices are VULNERABLE!”</a> article to learn about how one of these endpoints allows attackers to easily bypass the security method if needed. This of course, like all forms of MFA, varies depending on the layers that are within it. I’m of course ONLY talking about scenarios that involve the pin code method.</p> <p></p> <p>We need to be mindful that when implementing other endpoints for accessibility that can also apply the security method, we need to think several steps ahead, stuff like “is said endpoint secure enough to handle this feature?”, “what would happen in the event that it’s compromised”. We consistently get full of ourselves, thinking that the implementation of the method itself will suffice, that it is impenetrable, yet overlook the stuff like this, weaknesses that can turn it into rumble. </p> <p></p> <p>In terms of overall convenience, as harsh as this may sound, sometimes you need to limit how convenient it is to apply the method in order to ensure it's not easily exploitable. This can include from a wide range of stuff like either limiting how the user applies it, or, I some cases, how often the end user is required to use it, which leads into stuff like "Zero-Trust", which is a complex, yet secure form of security for any system infrastructure. I'll talk about that in another article. For now, let's stick to the main topic. </p> <p></p> <p>You can still make it more accessible and ensure that end users are able to use and implement it, but not TOO accessible if you see my main point? </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "argument" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Where am I going with this argument? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now, how does all of this apply to the topic up for discussion today? Well, believe it or not, SSO and OpenAuth, the main topic for today, as funny but not funny as this might sound, were MADE TO BE MORE CONVENIENT THAN IT IS SECURE. Don't believe me, well let me walk you through the overall concept of how these authentication methods function so that you see the point I’m trying to make. </p> <p></p> <p>Now, just to be CLEAR, I am NOT saying that whoever made this form of authentication method had the intention of NOT making it secure. I am simply just pointing out the major weaknesses in them based on how they were originally designed.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "sso">What is SSO (Single Sign On) 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Single sign on is the overall concept of being able to use ONE set of credentials to authenticate and log into multiple sessions with the same credentials that were used to authenticate to the first. Typically it’s used in infrastructures that have multiple sub layers or services that you would need to authenticate to. A good example of this would be WGU’s school system that deploys this method in order to allow you to authenticate to even your outlook mailbox with just your one session that you sign into the main student portal. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "openauth" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is OpenAuth 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This is a new form of authentication that is supposed to make sending over credentials a thing in the past, allowing you to basically send over passwordless credentials and authenticate to a system. This can also be done through mutual trusting parties such as the "Sign in with Google" option that you see on a lot of web applications that let you use your google log in session to authenticate.</p> <p></p> <p>This means that in theory if an attacker were to intercept a communication pipeline they would end up with nothing.</p> <p></p> <p>This method sounds lovely on paper, HOWEVER, there is one HUGE downfall to this… and why it needed some um… fixes cough requiring older security methods to patch it. It's one of the largest forms of a security breach waiting to happen. As a matter of fact it already has been. You can check a scenario on where OpenAuth is being used maliciously right <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/09/22/malicious-oauth-applications-used-to-compromise-email-servers-and-spread-spam/" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a> in order to infect and breach systems.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DangerSSOAndOpenAuth" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

Which will be available for PAID patreons only. There will also be a follow up video in the next bi-weekly issues that will feature a live programming video to demonstrate the process.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "hooking" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Hooking? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Hooking is the process of using covert methods, which are illegal function calls within a program in order to invoke malicious activity within a system. In a sense you can think of this as a form of living off the land, where you are exploiting a trusted application within a system to gain and further extend access to a system infrastructure. The end goal of this method is much the same as many common attack vector end goals, RCE(remote code execution), which will allow you to botnet and control systems on the network further. </p> <p></p> <p>Hooking leads into stuff like DLL and Code injection which are used in order to hook and infect the memory pages of the target application, to launch malicious payloads from within the program itself. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "dll" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is DLL injection? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>DLL injection is the process of exploiting something that is known as a dynamic library, which are a series of core functions that are loaded alongside applications on startup for any and all general purposes. This is a trusted process that the system recognizes and allows the program to perform each time it runs. There are different types of DLL files, each one pertaining to a particular operating system: kernel32.dll for windows, ld. so. conf for linux, .dylib for MAC OS systems. </p> <p></p> <p>Essentially what we are doing using this injection method, is piggybacking off of the base address of where the DLL file is being loaded from on the system, in order to spoof our address as its address to come up as a legitimate process on the main system. This is also done on top of obfuscation methods to mask our activity on the system we are infecting. We need to blend in as much as possible in order to avoid being detected!</p> <p></p> <p>This allows us to mask in our own source code, which can be used in order to infect the system further.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "code" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Code injection 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Code injection is a much similar process much like DLL injection. The key difference here is that this is more focused around the masking of shell code that is converted to hexadecimal format, and then obfuscated in order to RCE the system.</p> <p></p> <p>These two methods can be combined in order to do both in one go if needed. You can use either or to get the job done! If you get creative with it, you can nest in RCE commands, that also pipe in source code for you to infect the system with.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://www.patreon.com/posts/pentest-phases-102728942" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

Cyber Security, as I’ve said before, is a game of chess, one that requires you to be several steps ahead in order to defend our digital landscape. </p> <p></p> <p>For one to assume there is no weakness in a system, no matter how well sound it might be, is a CRITICAL mistake, one that plagues the industry today stares at the MITIRE company data breach. Know this well… THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A 100% SECURE SYSTEM. For as long as it is man made it will always contain some form of flaw or error in them. People are able to make mistakes, therefore, said programs will also reflect said mistakes.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "bypass" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! MAC Address filtering can be bypassed! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Mac address filtering involves configuring a network access point to only allow permitted devices to authenticate and access the internal network. In the event that an unauthorized user tries to access the internal network, the MAC address that is tied to their system will be checked and flagged by the security of the access point if it isn’t registered as a permitted device. </p> <p></p> <p>For most this would appear as a great form of security overall. Only the administrator that configured the MAC address cache for the access point will be able to see which MAC addresses you need in order to be permitted to the network. Solid right? WRONG!</p> <p></p> <p>Here is the major flaw with this setup….. There are 2 EASY ways to bypass this rule.</p> <p></p> <p>#1:</p> <p></p> <p>You can tap into the direct network feed if you find an open PHYSICAL network port. This also allows you to bypass any authentication methods that might be set in place even if you manage to spoof the MAC address through other means and get blocked by the WPA2 authentication process.</p> <p></p> <p>Even if you find the right MAC address, if they have a complex password to join the network, then you’re out of luck if you try to do this the wireless method and you can't crack the password. It is possible to bypass using just the MAC address alone, but like all forms of wireless security, it's constantly improving and evolving over time, making some of these methods hard if not IMPOSSIBLE to easily pull off.</p> <p></p> <p>Physical network taps, which typically do NOT require authentication, allows you to bypass this simple filter. </p> <p></p> <p>#2:</p> <p></p> <p>The MAC addresses for any and all systems that are connected to the internal network are sent out in data packets, via “stations” that are connected to the main access point. </p> <p></p> <p>With a simple tool like Aircrack-ng, you can use monitoring mode to sniff out all the data channels and see which systems are connected to the network to spoof any and all internal MAC addresses, allowing you to bypass the security and authenticate to the network. </p> <p></p> <p>Of course there are other means to do this, but these are methods that I have tried and have succeeded with that have allowed me to breach access points that I have personally setup for these types of tests.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "hiding" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! Hiding your SSID can be bypassed 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A common trick that a lot of people like to use in order to prevent unauthorized network breaches, is they like to hide their SSID’s which is the name of the network. This is effective in that you can hide SSID information from common means of exposure, like the GUI you use when selecting a wireless access point to communicate with.</p> <p></p> <p>The problem with this is it can easily be bypassed by the same method mentioned in option #2 of how to bypass MAC address filtering. </p> <p></p> <p>Your SSID is also broadcasted along with any and all MAC address information that is sent out in data packets. They have to be, otherwise our IoT devices would be unable to pick them up and identify them. THERE IS ALWAYS A WAY TO BYPASS ANYTHING! NOTHING IS 100 PERCENT SECURE!</p> <p></p> <p>Today’s positive bonuses will focus more on how to defend against MAC address filtering bypasses, preventing an attacker from breaching the network via this security method.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "hhttps://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DangerSSIDMACFILTERING" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

It's the overall process of enumerating the entire file system, and then applying what is known as symmetric cryptography in order to encrypt the entire data storage medium. A good example of this would be bitlocker, which is commonly used for Windows system infrastructures.</p> <p></p> <p>As you know, data encryption is irreversible without the crypto keys, so by performing this method and leaving the keys out the hands of the attacker, should they breach the system, whether it be digitally or physically, any and all data they steal will be useless to them.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "cookies" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What are COOKIES? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Symmetric cryptography, also known as single key cryptography, is the process of using a singular crypto key known as a private key in order to both encrypt as well as decrypt data. It's commonly more used for FDE over Asymmetric due to it being the faster encryption method.</p> <p></p> <p>This makes sense as the overall process for FDE is to enumerate THE ENTIRE file system ENTIRELY and encrypt EVERY single file on the system. Asymmetric would be too slow for this as it's a slower encryption standard. It's also commonly used in mobile device data encryption as well for the same reasons.</p> <p></p> <p>Asymmetric encryption on the other hand uses two crypto keys to perform the same process, except, in this case, it uses a public key for encryption, and a private key for decryption. The main reason for this is to add more secure complexity for various data communication methods. It’s also commonly used in stuff like PGP, pretty good privacy, which is commonly used for secure email data encryption.</p> <p></p> <p>One of the BIGGEST downfalls of symmetric data encryption is it's VULNERABLE to interception attacks. Should an attacker intercept the crypto key, they can: decrypt all data and messages, replay new ones on behalf of the original recipients, and a lot more.</p> <p></p> <p>However, with Asymmetric encryption, this isn't the case. Since it uses two crypto keys which come in pairs, Should a threat actor intercept the communication pipeline and steal one of the keys, their efforts will be in vain, as they lack one of the means to facilitate a SOLID man in the middle attack.</p> <p></p> <p>The whole premise of a man in the middle attack is to not only intercept the communication, but to reply messages on behalf of the respective parties. By using public key cryptography on top of other data channel splitting techniques, you render this the ineffective and leave them in a situation where they can’t facilitate it fully.</p> <p></p> <p>Should an attacker secure the public key only, then they'll only be able to send messages. They won't be able to read any of the data that is being sent back and forth, and any new messages will be suspected as false ones, which will lead to the replacing of the keys. Even if they verify with the key, it will all be for nothing.</p> <p></p> <p>However, in the event they have the private key, they'll be able to decrypt any and all messages, BUT, they won't be able to spoof and gain further insight and other information out of the communication pipeline. This is still a problem for them due to the fact most PKI infrastructures, even stuff like PGP, REQUIRE you to have the public key BEFORE you begin a communication to ensure message authenticity from the recipients. Simply not having the public key is like a lack of ID to verify who you are…. WHICH MEANS A DEAD PRIVATE KEY! This does vary depending on the infrastructure so do be mindful as I'm going over this.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "cookiehijacking" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Cookie Session Hijacking? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now that we've gone over the basics, let's talk about what Ransomware is.</p> <p></p> <p>Ransomware is basically FDE with malicious intent. It's a form of malware that is known as "crypto" malware, which deploys cryptographic techniques that enumerate the victims file system, exfiltrating data from it, and then encrypting the main copy of the data on the file system, rendering it useless to them. Be mindful that "crypto" malware and "ransomware" are TWO different forms of malware. Crypto malware is the main archetype, where as Ransomware is the child of said archetype, inheriting cryptographic techniques. </p> <p></p> <p>After the data is encrypted, a message is displayed to the end user requiring them to pay a "ransom" in order to receive the crypto keys to decrypt their data, hence the name "ransomware". The problem with this is paying the ransom doesn't guarantee you will receive the keys.</p> <p></p> <p>Ransomware is on the rise for being an effective attack method because it can be combined with phage malware techniques and phishing techniques to become SUPER effective.</p> <p></p> <p>Before, a simple click of the link or mishap in security meant you had an undetected botnet. NOW, it means all your data is encrypted and unreadable, which can be problematic if you're handling sensitive data that has to do with critical record information like someone's student or home loan payment information for example.</p> <p></p> <p>Mr.Robot for example, one of their biggest exploits in the show was encrypting all of E Corp's data in order to "FREE" everyone from debt. HOWEVER, it caused quite the opposite effect, where now people that were close to being debt free, or had funds in their bank accounts, were unable to access anything or prove what they've made payments due to the data being indecipherable. The result? TOTAL CHAOS where the people they were trying to “Free” suffered more.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/CookieSessionHijacking" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

The goal of the research project is to help educate small businesses run by women and other minority groups on proper Cyber Security practices. The QA was led by a woman named Grace Sommers. If you would like all the full in depth answers regarding the QA, you can find it on my patreon attached to the advanced version of this article. It's 9 pages and you can learn a lot about how to properly defend your digital systems from various attack vectors, including various endpoint security methods if that fancies you.</p> <p></p> <p>The more advanced version of this article is going to feature some more in depth techniques aside from the basic ones that will be discussed here today. As always, that will be for my patreon supporters only.</p> <p></p> <p>This article is a part of the Danger! Series, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p> <p></p> <p>Ransomware attacks are on the rise, and are a favorable attack method commonly used by a lot of crypto gangs. It's important to know how to protect yourself from these types of attacks. Ransomware, as shocking as this might sound, is EASY to stop, rather, easy to render useless. It's simply a matter of understanding the critical flaw within the attack method itself and what it relies on to execute.</p> <p></p> <p>Even with all of this you still need to know proper data mitigation techniques, since the attack method also focuses on data exfiltration. I'm going to teach you various mitigation strategies that not only protect you from ransomware attacks, BUT, protect various data endpoints to prevent exfiltration. Why? Even if you render a ransomware attack from crippling your infrastructure, the attacker STILL got away with sensitive data which they can use as they please. You need to observe all the little things to see the bigger picture.</p> <p></p> <p>I'll also be covering some basic stuff like FDE, cryptography, etc, so that you FULLY understand how the attack method works. Pay close attention to the cryptography stuff since you NEED to understand how it works, both from the perspective of a threat actor, as well as from an overall security standpoint perspective.</p> <p></p> <p>If you would like a demonstration of the technique, I wrote an article demonstrating how to write the code and perform the technique, as well as a live demonstration that can be found on my YouTube channel. If you would like to see the sample code for it, you can find it in my "Python-Pen-Testing-Tools" in my main Github Repository <a href = "https://github.com/RoyMBull/Python-Pen-Testing-Tools/blob/main/Python%20PenTesting%20Tools/Ransomeware.py" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "fde" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is FDE (Full disk encryption)? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Before we dive into what Ransomware is, let's go over what FDE is, since it heavily applies to the topic for today.</p> <p></p> <p>FDE, full disk encryption, is a defensive technique that is used to harden data protection across all hierarchical flat file systems. It's the overall process of enumerating the entire file system, and then applying what is known as symmetric cryptography in order to encrypt the entire data storage medium. A good example of this would be bitlocker, which is commonly used for Windows system infrastructures.</p> <p></p> <p>As you know, data encryption is irreversible without the crypto keys, so by performing this method and leaving the keys out the hands of the attacker, should they breach the system, whether it be digitally or physically, any and all data they steal will be useless to them.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "crypto" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Symmetric/Asymmetric Cryptography? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Symmetric cryptography, also known as single key cryptography, is the process of using a singular crypto key known as a private key in order to both encrypt as well as decrypt data. It's commonly more used for FDE over Asymmetric due to it being the faster encryption method.</p> <p></p> <p>This makes sense as the overall process for FDE is to enumerate THE ENTIRE file system ENTIRELY and encrypt EVERY single file on the system. Asymmetric would be too slow for this as it's a slower encryption standard. It's also commonly used in mobile device data encryption as well for the same reasons.</p> <p></p> <p>Asymmetric encryption on the other hand uses two crypto keys to perform the same process, except, in this case, it uses a public key for encryption, and a private key for decryption. The main reason for this is to add more secure complexity for various data communication methods. It’s also commonly used in stuff like PGP, pretty good privacy, which is commonly used for secure email data encryption.</p> <p></p> <p>One of the BIGGEST downfalls of symmetric data encryption is it's VULNERABLE to interception attacks. Should an attacker intercept the crypto key, they can: decrypt all data and messages, replay new ones on behalf of the original recipients, and a lot more.</p> <p></p> <p>However, with Asymmetric encryption, this isn't the case. Since it uses two crypto keys which come in pairs, Should a threat actor intercept the communication pipeline and steal one of the keys, their efforts will be in vain, as they lack one of the means to facilitate a SOLID man in the middle attack.</p> <p></p> <p>The whole premise of a man in the middle attack is to not only intercept the communication, but to reply messages on behalf of the respective parties. By using public key cryptography on top of other data channel splitting techniques, you render this the ineffective and leave them in a situation where they can’t facilitate it fully.</p> <p></p> <p>Should an attacker secure the public key only, then they'll only be able to send messages. They won't be able to read any of the data that is being sent back and forth, and any new messages will be suspected as false ones, which will lead to the replacing of the keys. Even if they verify with the key, it will all be for nothing.</p> <p></p> <p>However, in the event they have the private key, they'll be able to decrypt any and all messages, BUT, they won't be able to spoof and gain further insight and other information out of the communication pipeline. This is still a problem for them due to the fact most PKI infrastructures, even stuff like PGP, REQUIRE you to have the public key BEFORE you begin a communication to ensure message authenticity from the recipients. Simply not having the public key is like a lack of ID to verify who you are…. WHICH MEANS A DEAD PRIVATE KEY! This does vary depending on the infrastructure so do be mindful as I'm going over this.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "ransomware" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Ransomware? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now that we've gone over the basics, let's talk about what Ransomware is.</p> <p></p> <p>Ransomware is basically FDE with malicious intent. It's a form of malware that is known as "crypto" malware, which deploys cryptographic techniques that enumerate the victims file system, exfiltrating data from it, and then encrypting the main copy of the data on the file system, rendering it useless to them. Be mindful that "crypto" malware and "ransomware" are TWO different forms of malware. Crypto malware is the main archetype, where as Ransomware is the child of said archetype, inheriting cryptographic techniques. </p> <p></p> <p>After the data is encrypted, a message is displayed to the end user requiring them to pay a "ransom" in order to receive the crypto keys to decrypt their data, hence the name "ransomware". The problem with this is paying the ransom doesn't guarantee you will receive the keys.</p> <p></p> <p>Ransomware is on the rise for being an effective attack method because it can be combined with phage malware techniques and phishing techniques to become SUPER effective.</p> <p></p> <p>Before, a simple click of the link or mishap in security meant you had an undetected botnet. NOW, it means all your data is encrypted and unreadable, which can be problematic if you're handling sensitive data that has to do with critical record information like someone's student or home loan payment information for example.</p> <p></p> <p>Mr.Robot for example, one of their biggest exploits in the show was encrypting all of E Corp's data in order to "FREE" everyone from debt. HOWEVER, it caused quite the opposite effect, where now people that were close to being debt free, or had funds in their bank accounts, were unable to access anything or prove what they've made payments due to the data being indecipherable. The result? TOTAL CHAOS where the people they were trying to “Free” suffered more.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "strategy" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What should you do during a Ransomware Attack? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the biggest misconceptions about ransomware attacks, a common question that gets asked, is what do you do in the event of a ransomware data breach? This is a VERY bad question to ask, as it under prepares many business infrastructures on how to deal with actual ransomware threats.</p> <p></p> <p>The real practical question to ask is what do you do BEFORE a ransomware attack occurs? Still scratching your head? Let me explain.</p> <p></p> <p>You see, in the event that a ransomware attack connects, THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO!!!! Ransomware is an IRREVERSIBLE process, where unless you have the crypto keys, which are in the hands of the attacker, there is NOTHING you can do. Even if you pay the ransom, you're not guaranteed to be given the crypto keys to re-acquire the data that has been stolen. You also have loads of fines that stack along with the ransomware breach that you are required to report on top of that.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "mitigation" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the simplest means to prevent damage from this type of attack? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the SIMPLEST yet COMMONLY ignored methods to prevent ransomware from being super effective BEFORE it strikes is the usage of constant data backups. There are two main types: inferential and differential backups.</p> <p></p> <p>Differential backups are full backups where you backup any and all data across the board. This is done at certain time frames regularly to back up large quantities of data at a time.</p> <p></p> <p>Incremental backups are partial backups where you backup portions of data at a time. This is common practice on top of the differential one as you'll often have a case where certain portions of data need to be backed up. Think of it like this, if you modified a file on your flash drive, would you back up the entire drive again? Doesn't make sense right? This is where you would apply this method.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DangerRansomware" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

I'll even cover one of the best FREE beginner tools that you can use to apply the technique in a more automated fashion.</p> <p></p> <p>If you would like to see how to perform remote file inclusion, as well as the best means to do so, then I suggest checking out this video <a href = "https://www.patreon.com/posts/lab-python-104381028" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a> from my patreon lab for the TCPBackdoor exploit.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "remote" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Remote File inclusion? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Remote file inclusion is the process of directly uploading malicious files/payloads to a remote web application server in order to have it become a part of the main file archives that belong to it.. This allows the threat actor to infect and or control the web application on a massive scale, as well as deliver unsuspecting payloads to end users that use said service. If done correctly. it can lead to the compromising of many end user networks and IoT devices if not mitigated correctly.</p> <p></p> <p>As you know, web application servers use the HTTP/HTTPS protocol to host various html files that end users can access through the internet on behalf of a web browser application. When you visit a website, you're auto directed to the main HTML index page welcoming you to the site. From there the end user browses the site through the main UI(user interface) which will allow them to view any and all HTML pages that are hosted on the web application, as well as any other fields that might be included with it.</p> <p></p> <p>Web applications, as I’ve mentioned earlier, host various other files that are accessible to the end user, like executables, that are auto downloaded to their system the moment they visit the resource location on the server.</p> <p></p> <p>For example: https://website[.]com/Download.exe (JUST AN EXAMPLE! IT'S NOT REAL)</p> <p></p> <p>When you visit this link, it will download a file that is known simply as "Download.exe". Much like how when you visit an HTML page, it's automatically displayed and interpreted on the screen for you, downloadable non HTML files are auto downloaded to your system for you to use.</p> <p></p> <p>Remote file inclusion exploits both of these things discussed about web applications in 2 ways.</p> <p></p> <p>#1, it can host fake pages and replace the pre-existing ones with spoofed pages that are malicious.</p> <p></p> <p>Ever heard of a website that was hacked, and suddenly all the "legitimate" web pages on it were now all malicious and infected end user systems? Well this is how REAL threat actors go about it when they compromise a web application.</p> <p></p> <p>By exploiting this vulnerability in a LEGITIMATE web application, you not only trick the web browser and security in place to protect the end user from spoofed sites, BUT, you also trick the end user into visiting pages that are malicious, allowing them to steal sensitive credentials, and even land a botnet onto the end user network should they want to extend their overall attack surface.</p> <p></p> <p>#2, it can be used to host executables that are auto downloaded to the victim's system</p> <p></p> <p>It's no shocker that one of the bread and butters for a threat actor is to use this technique to host malicious payloads that are auto downloaded to the victim's system. This can be deadly if it's a majorly trusted executable whose signature is also spoofed and ran on the target system.</p> <p></p> <p>Imagine VSCode, a desktop application that is commonly trusted and downloaded onto millions of systems daily, suddenly replaced with a fake version that was trusted by any and all end user systems? This would lead to a massive breach on many systems, as it's also possible for an attacker to spoof the signature of the software to bypass security. They can even do stuff like DLL and Code injection, as well as many obfuscation techniques to go undetected. The list goes on with the amount of creativity and devastating dama that can be done should an attacker land this critical flaw against a well trusted system</p> <p></p> <p>#3 it can allow you to pull of RCE and directory traversal</p> <p></p> <p>If you manage to pop a php file to a web application, you basically have a remote backdoor into the system that you can tap into whenever you need to and further extend your reach to the network the web application is hosted on.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "local" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is local file inclusion? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Local file inclusion, also known as directory traversal, is a technique that allows you to browse the web application's file system. This isn't a form of RCE no, BUT, it does allow you to browse stuff that is outside the bounds of the web application root directory.</p> <p></p> <p>As mentioned before, when you visit a web application you are accessing the HTML files via the file system of the web application.</p> <p></p> <p>For security reasons, in order to prevent you from accessing files outside those bounds, you are prohibited from being able to view anything that is not a part of the main web application root directory that is configured for it.</p> <p></p> <p>Directory traversal bypasses this security and allows you to access any and all files that are sensitive on the system.</p> <p></p> <p>This can also lead to RCE because should you, in the event there is an open SSH service for example, should you happen to find the credentials to connect with the right privileges, you can extend your attack surface.</p> <p></p> <p>You can also view any and all sensitive files to gain access to password data that can allow you to compromise any services that are tied to the web application, such as the administrative credentials for login pages if they happen to be there.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "difference" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The difference between the two? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The biggest overall difference between remote file inclusion and local file inclusion, is that remote file inclusion is more you uploading and or replacing legitimate files on the web application to infect it.</p> <p></p> <p>Local file inclusion is more used to browse the system to find sensitive files and or credentials. You can exploit this in various ways, even through programs on the file system that print text data from various files in the web application system.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "rce" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is RCE? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>RCE, RCE, RCE! You’ve been hearing me say this a lot, but I haven’t quite yet explained what it means right? </p> <p></p> <p>RCE, remote code execution, is the main goal and bread and butter for any and all forms of injection exploits against any system. It's commonly applied to various things: buffer overflows via obfuscated malware, remote code execution, SQL injection, etc. It’s also just a common end game for any form of breach. </p> <p></p> <p>Your end goal is to always find a way to RCE a system in order to control it directly via shell code commands, which can be combined with various coding techniques to deal more damage.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/RemoteLocalFileInclusion" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

Much like how in the DLL injection article where I mention there will be a followup article later on with live footage to show the exploit, the same will be the case with this article as well. This is to ensure you have the proper knowledge and that it marinates before we dive into the real thing. </p> <p></p> <p>Security is something that is HIGHLY neglected during many software development projects. I’ve talked a bit about this before, but if security is not kept in mind, it can lead to some pretty crazy stuff, like for example, OpenAuth and SSO.

It’s also portable, so if you happen to snapshot the system, you can carry it to another VM of the same type and then pop it there. </p> <p></p> <p>Windows Recall is a part of the main Windows Copilot Runtime , which is an AI based API.</p> <p></p> <p>It relies on the User Activity API, which is a C# focused API, in order to create screenshots and encapsulate sessions that have to do with the end user data that is on the system: Overall user activity, data, data accounts, as well as any and all tasks that were running on the main system at the time.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "screenshot" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a system screenshot? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>System screenshots, often performed for virtual machines, is a mechanic that allows you to screenshot the entire state of the local system from all various endpoints: memory, tasks, running browser sessions and any cookie data with it, etc. </p> <p></p> <p>Think of it like “quick save” when you are playing a video game. Once you reach a certain checkpoint, OR, after a certain period of time, the game will “save” itself, in which, depending on the game, you can go back in time and pick up where you left off. </p> <p></p> <p>System snapshots is also a technique that is commonly used for forensics purposes, weather it be maliciously or defensively. It can be used, for example, to retrieve crypto keys that are often stored in memory while during live run time of the system. This can be vital for data recovery purposes in case you lost the keys, OR, in the eyes of an attacker, it can be used to decrypt any and al sensitive data with it to compromise a system infrastructure. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "caution" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">CAUTION! READ FIRST! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Since Windows Recall is fairly new, these are just theories on how it can be exploited, which is not fully set in stone until people exploit it (which many have done so already). </p> <p></p> <p>Feel free to theorize and let me know various other ways this feature can be exploited and drop a comment in the comments section bellow. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "negative" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY!

RECALL WILL HELP THREAT ACTORS RESTORE THE SYSTEM SO THEY CAN RETRIEVE IT!</p> <p></p> <p>See where I'M going with this? No matter what you do, threat actors are able to essentially go back in time and revert the process since the main state of the system has been PERFECTLY saved in memory.

When you enter in the name of an item you want to purchase, a GET request is made to the backend of the server, in which it will perform a database query that will retrieve the elements form the database, placing it in the given fields where the main web application wishes to present them to you.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, when you search “cats”, in lets say a website for example, the main HTTP GET request, as well as the name of the item you are searching for is processed by the backend that will allow GET requests, parsing it, and piping in a request like so</p> <p></p> <p>“SELECT makeup FROM makeuptable WHERE Product_ID=”YOUR_INPUT”. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "post" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the POST HTTP request? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The POST HTTP method is commonly used in scenarios where the HTTP server needs to handle user input data and submit it, like login data for example, or any kind of data that needs to be processed by the backend in order to perform a specific action. The backend handles said data, and then processes it to the system for a variety of purposes: resources directly on the file system, database queries, etc. </p> <p></p> <p>It can also be used to upload stuff like files for remote file inclusion for example. </p> <p></p> <p>It can also be used for simple retrieval purposes if needed to, but the main purpose of the request is to do what I just mentioned.</p> <p></p> <p>Threat actors commonly exploit the POST HTTP method in order to perform a variety of server side attacks, since, depending on how the backend of the HTTP server is configured to handle the processed data, they can manipulate the system in a variety of unique ways: SQL injection, Command injection, Cross Site Scripting, etc. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "put" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the PUT HTTP request? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The PUT HTTP method is used in order to modify and update resources that are already on the HTTP server file system. </p> <p></p> <p>It can also be used, depending on how the PUT request method is programmed for the backend, be used to add an entirely new resource to the system itself. </p> <p></p> <p>I say this strongly because, one of the obvious things to do as a security professional would be to ONLY allow it to update resources which is what it’s designed to do.</p> <p></p> <p>If a threat actor finds a way to pull this HTTP method off, they can basically remotely include as many files as they want to the server and exploit the system in a variety of ways. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "delete" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the POST HTTP request? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The DELETE HTTP method is the opposite of the PUT HTTP request method, where instead of adding or updating files/resources on the main file system, it instead REMOVES them from the file system. </p> <p></p> <p>For this one, since it’s obvious, you can wrap your head around what’ll happen if an attacker is able to pull this off.</p> <p></p> <p>This can be CRUCIAL for stuff like modifications to an end user account, when you change stuff like your username for example, as well as various aspects of information that need SPECIFIC ways of being updated on the HTTP server file system, that might or might not have to do with the end user specifically. </p> <p></p> <p>It sounds a bit complicated, but try to process the example I’ve just mentioned</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/HTTPRequestsMethods" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

It’s one of the biggest reasons in the event of a real situation where there is a threat to the safety of others concerning certain forms of data, business infrastructures refuse to disclose it unless there is a certain process they undergo to safely do so. </p> <p></p> <p>This article is a part of the Danger! Series, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent.

Think (DON’T ACTUALLY THINK!!) of it like “porn” but for pedophiles. It can be collected and fabricated in various ways. </p> <p></p> <p>This form of content is HIGHLY illegal, where often times it’s fabrication results in the sexual assault and abuse of actual children to make it. There are even human trafficking operations where children are explicitly kidnapped for these purposes on top of other things. </p> <p></p> <p>Due to its nature, a lot of underground activity for it occurs on the dark net in order to serve it to its ahem… “high” following fanbase. </p> <p></p> <p>There have also been other means to fabricate it such as A.I for example, which can turn pictures of children into sexually inappropriate content, or even create said content out of whatever data is available to them even if it doesn't involve actual pictures of children. </p> <p></p> <p>CSAM has also gotten to the point where Kids are being harassed and extored online into sending this type of content to predators, which has lead to the deaths of many via suicide.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "e2e" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is End to End (E2E) Encryption? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the main topics for today is to talk about the dangers of E2E encryption, and how it’s being used by companies to “turn a blind eye” to CSAM cases. </p> <p></p> <p>This form of encryption, although it sounds good on paper, has LOTS of fatal flaws depending on WHERE and HOW it’s used. In the event of something basic like PGP for emails or a PKI system, where public and private crypto keys are being used to exchange data for business infrastructures, this is harmless. There are also means to strip the network traffic should it be necessary for security within the infrastructure.</p> <p></p> <p>In the event of how certain social media platforms implement it: Meta, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc. it can be a deadly tool to allow platforms that CHILDREN operate on to be vulnerable to sex extortion cases and can be a means for servicing CSAM material.</p> <p></p> <p>End to End encryption's biggest enabler for CSAM, is that NO THIRD PARTIES are able to intercept and view ANY of the traffic that is being sent between various main parties, including THE COMPANY THEMSELVES.</p> </br> </br></br> <h4 id = "social" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">E2E allows social media platforms to turn a blind eye to CSAM! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Ever noticed what the ruckus was when platforms like meta implemented end to end data encryption? </p> <p></p> <p>It’s not due to the fact it’s being used to secure end user text messages and data, which would be a good thing if only the case. </p> <p></p> <p>The PROBLEM is these types of platforms cater to both adults and CHILDREN! They can coexist and interact with each other at the same time. Even with stuff like messenger for kids, it’s still possible to make a dummy account and interact with children.</p> <p></p> <p>With end to end encryption, pedophiles and other forms of cyber criminal activity can go left unnoticed, or to better phrase it, “indecipherable’</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DangerE2E" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

It’s an abundance of FREE knowledge, one that if you know how to use it, you’ll become one of the most skilled and dangerous hackers of all time. Think of the Metasploit as all your “past lives”. You have access to all of that information. You just need to learn how to use it properly. </p> <p></p> <p>This article will of course be video oriented, and will only be available to PAID patreon members only. </p> <p></p> <p>It’s no shocker that it’s a staple tool in every hacker’s tool belt, but shockingly enough, due to how times have changed, I don’t quite see it picked up by newcomers or talked about enough anymore. I know it still sees light and people use it, but nowadays I rarely hear anyone post or even talk about it, and it’s one of the standard tools much like aircrack-ng. People forget that a lot of newer tools are based on the original ones that are known and loved by the hacker community.</p> <p></p> <p>Recently one of my favorite authors ran into an issue where someone thought recommending Aircrack-NG was a horrible idea due to how old it is, when it is in face one of THE best pentesting tools hands down to seamlessly crack various wireless encryption: WEP, WPA, WPA2, etc. Even most pentesting methodologies or tools mimic it in some shape or format just like with metasploit.</p> <h4 id = "metasploit">What is Metasploit? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Metasploit is an offensive security penetration testing framework that can be used for a variety of penetration testing methodologies: web application, networking, C&C/botneting, mobile hacking, etc. It’s a multi-tool power house in case you haven’t noticed, and has left a legacy, where tools like SET, routersploit and even kali nethunter mimic in terms of overall terminal functional and design. It also has one of the best well maintained database archives of any and all exploits that exist in its database. The code written and stored in it is beyond our deserving.</p> <p></p> <p>Metasploit is also both an easy to use tool for beginners as well as a complex tool for more advanced folks in the hacking community, one that can require a bit of skill to use effectively. It’s also one of THE most maintained tools that you could ever pick up, as most tools, even if they’re super good and practical, lack support and maintenance, EVEN, if they happen to surpass it overall in functionality. It helps even more as most of the stuff is already there so no need to reinvent the wheel, just build on top of it, which many have like I’ve said before. </p> <p></p> <p>I’m going to talk about some of the opinions that you’ll see in the framework and what they mean as it can be quite confusing. </p> <h4 id = "aux">Auxiliary Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>If you’ve noticed in my hacking with Shodan exploit guide, you’ll notice that when I use the shodan module, in the module address in the metasploit framework, the first part of the address begins with “auxiliary”, which indicates that that the module you are using is a form of information gathering tool. </p> <p></p> <p>You can use various auxiliary tools in metasploit for various purposes: port scanning, OSNIT, etc. </p> </br> <h4 id = "exploit">Exploit Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the most commonly well known module formats in metasploit, the exploit module, is basically an auto pwn exploit, where you simply need to pass in the coordinates, or configuration: IP, port, any word lists depending on the module, etc, and the tool set will do ti’s thing.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, for setting up reverse TCP shells, you have the classic exploit/multi-handler module which allows you to set up a multi purpose server that can be set to work with: linux, mac, and windows payloads, and auto pwn the system should you get the executable up and running on it. </p> </br> <h4 id = "payloads">Payloads 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Payloads are an interesting feature, as MANY don’t quite understand how to use them properly.</p> <p></p> <p>Payloads are basically the malicious code or executable that you’d often have to use mfvenom for in order to generate them, along with setting them inside exploit modules like with hacking mobile devices to get them up and running. </p> <p></p> <p>They are standalone and need to be delivered to the target in order for them to work. How you go about that is all up to you. </p> <p></p> <p> Next, I’m also going to also go over some other stuff you ONLY do with the msfvenom feature that is a part of the metasploit framework: encoders, evasion, etc.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/metasploit" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

Series, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "wap" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a WAP? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>WAP, which stands for wireless access points, are the various gateway networking devices that we use to access various local networks including the internet: routers, hubs, switches, etc. They host various endpoint devices: laptops, desktops, mobile devices, CCTV systems, that are able to communicate with each other on the network via various networking protocols like TCP/IP for example, allowing them to exchange various data packets in order to communicate. Think of WAP’s, in the case of this article, like your “house”, where you are trying to “protect” it. You still following me? Good!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "spof" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is SPOF 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>SPOF, which stands for Single Point of Failure is when one endpoint or vulnerability leads to a SIGNIFICANT compromise of a multitude of systems in an infrastructure(s). </p> <p></p> <p>For example, the common element of a human factor via phishing and social engineering. It doesn't matter how many security factors you have at play, if even ONE person screws up and lets the threat actor in, then it is all for naught, hence it is a SPOF.</p> <p></p> <p>Let’s try another factor, but this time a bit more technical. Let’s say you happen to have multiple endpoints with application systems on them facing each other, many of which have access to each other's resources, even the most critical ones. In the event should ONE of these systems, or even if it were a singular system that was connected to everything in the same manner, it would lead to a MASSIVE SPOF that could do some heavy damage to the infrastructure. </p> <p></p> <p>Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, let’s dive into the main dangers that could happen should a your WAP happen to be compromised. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "hackers" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Your WAP aid’s hackers 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Anonymity is one of the biggest assets for a threat actor. It allows them to go undetected and remain untraced. There are NUMEROUS ways to go about this: burner phones, burner laptops, tor, FREE wifi spots, etc, BUT, did you know that YOUR AP(Access Point) can be used as a means to allow threat actors to keep their anonymity. </p> <p></p> <p>Now this doesn’t sound too bad right? Someone wants to use your wifi without your consent, not a big deal! WRONG! It becomes a HUGE deal when what they are doing is being traced back to YOUR location and IP address. Even if you are innocent, if the odds are law enforcement tracks back malicious activity to your IP address you suddenly are thrown under the bus by something you didn’t do. </p> <p></p> <p>Everything I’m saying is a COMMON tactic that hackers use to stay off the radar. If you use someone elses WIFI, it even let’s you do the one thing threat actors should NEVER do, which is hack from the comfort of your own home.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DangerWAP" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

BUT, don’t be misled by what you see on paper. Not everything translates well. </p> <p></p> <p>The main overall goal of A.I., which stands for “Artificial intelligence”, as I’ve mentioned, is to serves to overall be a replication of human intelligence. That’s the goal of computing technology overall, as we’ve quite LITERALLY tricked an actual rock into THINKING… AND IT WORKED. Computing technology is supposed to be an extension as well as amplification of the human intellect and capabilities. So far we have computers that are able to follow instructions and perform tasks with 100 percent accuracy and proficiency at incomprehensible speeds…. just as long as it’s been programmed to do so CORRECTLY of course. The big downside of this, as impressive as this might all sound….. Is it’s NOT actual HUMAN intelligence. It is just an imitation of it. The problem with A.I. is we’ve falsely assumed we’ve surpassed human intelligence when we couldn’t be further from the truth. We haven’t even replicated it, yet we seem to think we’ve reached a new era of utopia where it’s far surpassed us. We’ve still got a long way to go. </p> <p></p> <p>I’m also going to talk about why I don’t like A.I., which is mostly due to the FALSE image that it has implanted in our minds and WHY I’m enjoying it’s slow and inevitable downfall. I’m a HUGE tech enthusiast, and am VERY open minded to many implementations of it. Tech has advanced society to limits that I wouldn’t have imagine possible, which also lead to it HELPING a lot of people overall, as well as made things more accessible for the disabled: prosthetics, eye care, hearing impaired, etc, the list goes on. Typically technology BENEFITS EVERYONE and has a POSITIVE effect (ahem… I know what you’re thinking just go with it haha), but in the case of A.I, it has lead to the false impression of a utopia that simply WILL NEVER EXIST! One where the robots will do all the work for us so we can just sit back and relax and prosper from it. We looked only at the short term of A.I. and not the long term, and because of that, we are PAYING a hefty price for it. It’s being used to REPLACE us, NOT HELP US. </p> <p></p> <p>Lastly, I’ll also be covering a few HUGE security risks and COPY right laws that come into factor regarding it. </p> <p></p> <p>This article is a part of the Danger! Series, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent.

Think of it like raising a child, and slowly educating it over the years. The human brain has the learning capacity to retain experiences far and wise no matter how much time has passed, which is what we are trying to simulate. This is also what is commonly known as Machine Learning. One of the most commonly used programming languages for data structures is poses and brags PYTHON.</p> <p></p> <p>There is a HUGE flaw to this and I’ll discuss it shortly.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "jobs" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How A.I. has impacted the Job Market? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>As you might have noticed over the past 2 years so far, roles in tech, especially with software dev and Cyber, which pay the most, have taken a HUGE dive and have been experiencing MASSIVE layoffs and reduction in overall workforce size for various infrastructures. There are many financial factors that lead to this, but one of the most influential ones that I am going to discuss today has to do with the introduction of A.I.</p> <p></p> <p>A.I. has introduced the concept of automated work, which is a form of utopia that many have been craving for for a while now, essentially computers and other forms of machinery doing all the leg work for us while we just sit back and relax. In a perfect world, this would be wonderful. HOWEVER… the world doesn’t work like that.</p> <p></p> <p>What has been happening is businesses have been incorporating A.I. to essentially replace staff members due to the impression that A.I. can now do all of the work for us. This is due to a topic which I’ll discuss next.</p> <p></p> <p>This has overall left many out of work and in fear of being replaced by A.I. which so far has been the case, but is slowly coming to a standstill due to the obvious reasons, which I’ll dive more into next.</p> </br> <img src="Images/counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you would like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/DANGER_AI" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a>`;

Revolutionary, as it plays a vital role in how a computing system works on a binary level, using either a compiler or interpreter on behalf of a human readable programming language, to convert human readable instructions into code that a machine can understand. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "cobol" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">COBOL, the first HUMAN programming language, was invented by a WOMAN 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Yes, you heard that right ladies and gentlemen, the first modern human readable programming language that involved converting human words into machine code was made by a woman, specifically, “Grace Hopper”. She personally taught MEN and WOMEN how to use the language, which revolutionized the accessibility of programming. No more punch card systems. Without her we wouldn’t even have modern programming syntax that is mostly based on C.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 id = "fulltime" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The first full time paid programmers were Women 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Women were the first full time paid computer programmers, and were in charge of the ENIAC systems that relied on the punch card system. These systems were also responsible for bringing us to space via NASA’s Apollo Project in 1969.</p> <p></p> <p>The sad tale to this is women were considered to be just “refrigerator ladies” even though they played a major role in the advancement of computer technology which brought us to space. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "space" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Women took us to SPACE 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Yup, you heard that right! WOMEN TOOK US TO SPACE! A woman named “Margaret Hamilton” invented the “Apollo Code” in 1969, which took us to space for the very first time! I LOVE THIS WOMAN SO MUCH I JUST WANT TO SHAKE HER HAND AND GET HER AUTOGRAPH. You think she’d sign my laptop? NO…. MY CODE… SIGN MY CODE!!!! SIGN IT (remembers that this is an article and I’ve started nerding out).</p> <p></p> <p>I look up to this woman all the time and bring her up when I meet women that feel less encouraged to pursue technology.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "wifi" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">THEY INVENTED AND PIONEERED MODERN WIFI, GPS, AND BLUETOOTH 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A woman named “Hedy Lamarr”, was the sole inventor and pioneer of wireless technologies: WiFi, Bluetooth, as well as modern GPS systems and the security implementation behind them. </p> <p></p> <p>This also influences any and all modern technical standards like IEEE which ensure the overall standard and security set in place for modern day wireless technologies. </p> <p></p> <p>Without her we wouldn’t have cool wireless cards that hackers use to crack and pen-test against wireless standards and test their security.</p> <p></p> <p>We would also not have any form of satellite systems, microwave communication pipelines, GMS systems for cellular communication, etc, if she had not pioneered wireless technologies that are heavily implemented today. She plays one of the biggest roles in tech alongside “Margaret Hamilton” and “Ada Lovelace”.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "need" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Why we need more Women in Cyber Security 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>You can also check out these two sources if you wish to learn more about the history behind women in tech.</p> <p> <a href = "https://www.bricsys.com/en-eu/blog/computer-programing-a-brief-history" style = "text-decoration: none;">History Of Programing</a> </p> <p> <a href = "https://science.nasa.gov/people/margaret-hamilton/#hds-sidebar-nav-5" style = "text-decoration: none;">Margret Hamilton</a> </p> <p> <a href = "https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/hedy-lamarr" style = "text-decoration: none;">Hedy Lamarr</a> </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Articles/WhyWomenBelongInCyberSecurity" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid">  </a> </div>`;

When end users search anything on your site, it performs a query that retrieves data from the database that’s linked to your web application, stuff like: generic data, PII payment information, and a lot more. If you’re not careful, then threat actors can inject malicious code into the search bar that allows them to access more information than they should. This could lead to potential massive credential dumps, OR, them having the ability to either escalate privileges to admin or initiate themselves as administrators.</p> </br></br> <p>🎃 Local and Remote File inclusions</p></br> <p> Where I’ll test file uploads on your website to make sure threat actors can’t upload malicious code that could lead to backdoors being placed on your servers. If you’re not careful, threat actors could potentially upload malware that influences the entire backend of your site. They could do stuff like: replace legitimate pages with spoofed ones, perform privilege escalation, establish remote backdoors that allow them to pivot beyond the scope of where your web application is hosted, and a lot more. Ensuring these tests are done ensures the security and integrity behind your web application. </p> </br></br> <p>🎃 Session Hijacking & Cross Site Forgery</p></br> <p> Where I’ll test to see if there are any stuff like cookies and session tokens for example that don’t expire. Threat actors can exploit any means of remembering the end users session to hijack and gain access. </p> </br></br> <p>🎃 Cross Site Scripting</p> </br> <p> Where I’ll test to see if your site is vulnerable to scripts being injected on any of the pages. If you’re not careful, and should stuff like forum or comment sections be exploitable, it could lead to scripts that could potentially harm the end user being masqueraded on the page. It could lead to stuff like: keyloggers that track the end users keystrokes, as well as stuff like cookies being stolen which can pivot into session hijacking. </p> </br></br> <p>🎃 Login Security and Bruteforce testing</p></br> <p> Where I’ll test to see if your site is vulnerable to scripts being injected on any of the pages.

Book a session with me to see if there are any security issues on your network.</p> </br> <p>I’ll check for stuff like</p> </br></br> <p>🎃 Redundant systems</p> </br> <p> Which can lead to inactive systems that are trusted on the network being turned into bots. This allows threat actors to bypass internal security, infecting other systems, and even taking it further to perform living off the land advanced tactics where they utilize trusted software on your systems in order to compromise your internal infrastructure. You need to be careful about what you have on your network. I can check for what you do and don’t need and point you in the right direction.</p> </br></br> <p>🎃 Proper Port forwarding</p> </br> <p>If it’s an onsite job, I’ll test to see if your switched network applies proper port forwarding security. Port forwarding allows each individual port on your switched network to be assigned to a specific machine via network tap, blocking off access for threat actors, since in order for them to gain access they’d need to figure out the MAC address of the system assigned to it. Physical bypasses are one of the first things threat actors look for during a physical breach. It bypasses the need for a password to access the network and allows them to easily tap into network traffic not only for themselves, but for other systems on your network. </p> </br></br> <p>🎃 Proper subnetting implementation</p> </br> <p>Subnetting. Many hate it, but it’s the KEY to ensuring your internal network infrastructure is properly protected. Threat actors exploit stationary setups. By moving systems around on your network, and applying complex tactics, on top of implementing advanced security systems, I’ll be able to neutralize any chance of threat actors finding everything easily on your network. They’ll have to work for their food, and in doing so, will trigger security systems and various means to track their intrusive behavior. </p> </br></br> <p>🎃 Defense measures agaisnt network traffic interception</p> </br> <p>It’s most certainly possible to prevent threat actors from performing recon on your network infrastructure. Whether you want to is up to you! By combining what I’ve been explaining so far about network security, we can foster not only an environment that’s foreign to threat actors, but one where they can’t attempt to try and locate anything on top of subnetting measures that might be applied over the course of this service. </p> </br></br> <p>🎃 Potential open services that might exist </p> </br> <p>Identifying services on your network that are open on stuff like printers for example, helps prevent potential botnets, more so when it could potentially come from services you might heavily rely on for your business infrastructure such as file transfers and printing for example.</p> </br> <p>And a lot more! There’s endless testing that can be done here!</p> </br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; font-size: 30px;">🎃 What You’ll Do? 🎃</h4></br> <p>🎃 Forward me the overall scope for the Pentest and what I need to test for.

This is extremely bad considering the situation and current accusations stacked against them.</p> <p></p> <p>As of the time of writing this article, and I'm sorry to say this.... Heath Adams has OFFICALLY blocked me on LinkedIn. SO... if ANY, and I mean ANY of the posts I tag in this article, should they be redacted or change on his end, you know why! My credibility is HIGH and I speak ONLY the truth!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>HOWEVER, if by some sheer luck he does finally speak out regarding the situation with CONCRETE evidence, I'll happily retract everything in this article. I doubt it, BUT, let's move on!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What’s been going on regarding the TCM cert revoke situation 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>🎃 TCM is basically being accused of revoking someone’s certs they PAID for because they were being trolled by them in their Discord server via memes, jokes that were essentially harmless.</p> <p></p> <p>Link to the Tweet that went viral can be found here, which has over 337K views and 69 retweets.</p> <p></p> <p>Although the Tweet censors the name of the Discord member, it’s basically the student in question that Heath Adams claims cheated during their exam which he shows ZERO proof of.</p> <p></p> <p>Heath claims the student violated TCM’s policies and sought external help during their exam, but when asked to disclose this information, even a censored version of it, he chalks it up to "privacy policies" and refuses to disclose ANYTHING, and he does, it's misleading which I’ll talk about in a bit.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">TCM’s Stance on the matter 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This is an official response! from Heath Adams, founder and CEO of TCM Security.</p> <p></p> <p>In his initial response post, and I want you to be mindful of this later on in the article, HIS words exactly, was that he didn't know anything about the meme situation everyone’s been talking about. Apparently he didn't know the meme existed.</p> <p></p> <p>As you can tell, it sounds fishy because along with everything else that’s been going on, they’ve been refusing to disclose ANYTHING or provide SOLID proof of what’s been happening.</p> <p></p> <p>You can find out more about what I mean in this post here! from one of his official staff members that also does the same thing, where he defends TCM, but doesn’t disclose anything to clear up all the confusion that’s been going on with them on their end. Repost with my overall thoughts for it can be found here!.</p> <p></p> <p>Shortly after, Heath Updates us on the situation in another post, but AGAIN, STILL didn’t answer any questions DIRECTLY with EVIDENCE regarding the matter. I want you to pay CLOSE attention to this, as it becomes a concerning trend.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Suspicions About Heath and TCM 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The BIGGEST suspicion about TCM right now is how they’re handling the situation, SPECIFICALLY, their unwillingness to disclose ANY information regarding the matter, more so since they’re claiming a student cheated but refuses to disclose screenshots of any kind due to “privacy policies”.</p> <p></p> <p>The kicker, and something strange? They happily disclose a few Discord messages from a student named “Najam UI Saqib” who DID in fact cheat during his examination, which led to his certs getting revoked. HOWEVER, this was only due to his post that went viral which Heath HAD to respond to, otherwise it would just raise more suspicions that he’s hiding something.</p> <p></p> <p>NOW, he DOES in fact respond with OFFICIAL Discord server screenshots of what happened and Najam cheating and him blocking TCM staff and avoiding the situation. It gets SOOO bad that Najam actually DELETES his entire post regarding the matter after it went viral.</p> <p></p> <p>I was ECSTATIC, BUT, as you can tell it felt a little “strange”. Why? Because TCM was UNWILLING many times to disclose ANYTHING, and now all of a sudden they’re dropping screenshots and spilling the beans? Something just felt off about it, and guess what… I WAS RIGHT!</p> <p></p> <p>You can find out more about that here!</p> <p></p> <p>HOWEVER, Heath raised a HUGE red flag when he messaged me directly explaining it “wasn’t” the student he was talking about regarding his second follow up post. It’s strange because now apparently there were TWO students even though he never mentions that once in any of his posts. He led us under the impression that ONE student that cheated.</p> <p></p> <p>This did lead to me having to revise my post MULTIPLE times, even a few folks commenting they were still confused regarding the situation…. And to be honest… I was confused as well.</p> <p></p> <p>Something funny too, whenever ANYONE questioned what happened, Heath would BAN or BLOCK them RIGHT AWAY! He even kept an eye on people he felt would talk and looked them up on LinkedIn and blocked them right away, myself included, even if we didn't mention the companies name or his name.</p> <p></p> <p>You can find out what I mean in these two instances here!</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Instance1!</p> <p>🎃 Instance2!</p> <p></p> <p>There’s more of course, BUT, you get the point.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Heath Lied About Not Knowing the meme in question 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>In Heath’s first initial post regarding the matter, and I want you to think clearly about what I said before regarding his EXACT words, he mentions VERY CLEARLY he knows NOTHING about the meme everyone was talking about.</p> <p></p> <p>Sadly…. That too was also a lie. I have screenshots of him admitting and acting childish about it which is in the process of being released upon further notice.</p> <p></p> <p>The sad part about this, is he also lies about banning Panda, which panda confirms with DIRECT evidence that it was in fact Heath that DID ban him from the Discord server.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">TCM Revised Their Policies 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Shortly after the situation, TCM revised its policies which I found a little suspicious. Why? Because if it suddenly “changes” and no one is aware, it could lead to a situation where Heath could say stuff like this (meming) calls for a cert revoke. I’m not saying he would do that, BUT, it did scratch that part of my brain.</p> <p></p> <p>Nonetheless, I took a look at the core policies, which you can read here…. And…. well…. Panda didn’t violate anything nor is there a single screenshot of him cheating during the exam as Heath claims. The only person he had visible proof of doing so that he CONFIDENTLY exposes without question was the student I mentioned earlier, “Najam UI Saqib”.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Truth? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The REAL victim of the whole TCM situation… and I’m sorry to have to even say this… A LOT of the current evidence on deck DOES point towards their certs being revoked for speculated reasons, A LOT of which Heath admits to in his own Discord messages under his handle name.</p> <p></p> <p>You can find out more about the what's been going on via screen pics here!</p> <p></p> <p>There might be a further witness for the whole situation, BUT, I need her consent first before I feature her in the article. TRUST me on this, IF she does, and she releases further screenshots, it will be added to the massive archive of PHOTOGRAPHIC evidence I have for this article. You'll of course be kept up to date on this!</p> <p></p> <p>The student I’m talking about is named “ExecPanda”. If you go back to that twitter screenshot, you’ll see snippets of his profile pic exposed which IS an EXACT match!</p> <p></p> <p>He was kind enough to reach out to me via Discord and explain the situation to me in FULL detail with PROOF! He was honest about the whole thing, even the memeing and trolling on the server which DID call for the Discord ban. HOWEVER, this didn't justify his certifications being taken away from him, nor did it explain WHY they were taken away from him.</p> <p></p> <p>For those that might be wondering, since this has been aired out in the open, regarding the "joke/fake" cert situation with Panda, which he did admit to, this happens after his certs were revoked and removed without warning, where he was placed under investigation, also without warning. He assumes they're gone and have been revoked since he reached out to folks in the Discord server, most saying they still had theirs. This is WHY he does this. He also reaches out to staff formally and pops the question on whether or not they were revoked about an hour later after he does this, from which they CONFIRM his certs were revoked!</p> <p></p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Is TCM Still Reliable? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>To be very honest.. No… not after this.</p> <p></p> <p>This article was kind of hard to write, since I looked up to Heath Adams when I was in my earlier days as a hacker.</p> <p></p> <p>I spoke good faith about him MANY times, even featured him in some of my past articles for people that wanted to break into Cyber, but he dropped the ball on this one.</p> <p></p> <p>He had the potential to become one of the greats when it came to Cyber Security training and industry certs. Now I have to take back what I said and revise a lot of that stuff.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">After Thoughts 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This is going to be a bone chilling point I'm going to make.</p> <p></p> <p>Heath and everyone at TCM lectures us and says we should do our "research" yet prevents us from doing so.</p> <p></p> <p>The funny thing about what they're doing is when you prevent folks from researching it only leads to more speculation which can get out of hand.</p> <p></p> <p>It's even more sketchy since he openly discloses Najam but hides everything when it comes to Panda. You can expose one students handle name and all that but Panda is the exception?</p> <p></p> <p>The funny thing about what they're doing is when you prevent folks from researching it only leads to more speculation which can get out of hand.</p> <p></p> <p>The shady thing about this is they're supposed to inform him WHY his certs were revoked DIRECTLY with EXACT details! They just say he violated policies but NEVER specifically state what he did.</p> <p></p> <p>With Najam, they tell him. With Panda, they don't.</p> <p></p> <p>Just want you guys to let that marinate.</p> <p></p> <p>Thanks for reading folks!</p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!</p> <p></p> <p> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸</p> </br></br>  </div>`;

It's what got me where I am today and is what is allowing me to expand my opportunities!</p> <p></p> <p>You'll learn a lot of key stuff that could help you on your Cyber Security journey!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What's your end goal? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>When building a personal brand or any business (should you stray that path), the first thing you need to ask yourself is, "What do I plan to do with my brand?"</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>You see, A LOT of people are all brain no aim. They'll have all these ideas, have all the smarts in the world, but will lack the ability to FOCUS on a particular area their brand should be specializing in. It's ok to specialize in more than one thing, which I happen to be doing, BUT, there needs to be some form of correlation otherwise you'll run into a situation where folks will question your brand identify, such as "What... do you guys do?".</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>A good example of all of which I'm talking about can be found in one of my past articles here, where I talk about the goal for MY brand and all the types of stuff I do for it!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Having an objective for your brand will also make it easier to build out the overall schematics for it!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Be Authentic! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Ever seen a product so "unique" that you just knew you had to be apart of it!? This is where being authentic comes into play!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Personal brands are just that, PERSONAL! It's a reflection of your overall uniqueness and personal traits.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>WHY is this important? Here's a little analogy that I think you'll understand. Ever picked up a piece of "music" and you "felt" like it "spoke out to you"? Being authentic allows you to connect with others who share the same perspective as you!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>For example, part of my brand is a whole "gamified" Cyber Security vibe! This allows me to connect with folks in the Cyber realm, A LOT of which recognize a lot of the iconic themes and references I drop all the time. This allows me to build a relationship and network with them, establishing what is known as "reputational" value that plays a big factor into whether they wish to support my content!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Even the way I write my articles is authentic, in that I'm very "insightful", dinging the light bulb in folks head that gets them thinking!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Build a community! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Relationship building is the next step when it comes to networking!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>When you're building a personal brand, don't forget the emphasis on PERSONAL! If you want people to support you, you have to be able to CONNECT with them on a PERSONAL level! Failing to do so will have them question whether or not they should support your brand!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Me personally, I only engage and support those that interact with their community and GENUINELY mean it!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you've been paying close attention to all the Discord stuff I've been doing lately, my goal is to further connect with folks by chatting and engaging with them on a regular basis, as well as learning some more neat stuff about me, further relating to them!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How To Get Seen? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I can't say this works for all platforms, but IT SURE AS HECK works for LinkedIn!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Commenting and Engaging</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Commenting and Engaging, SPECIFICALLY on others posts allows you to establish some overall presence!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>When I was trying to get my name known in the Cyber Security field, I would comment under any and all major Cyber Security posts, even going as to challenge and enlighten those that have been at it longer than I have! This lead to my name getting seen and folks wanting to connect with me to hear more of what I had to say!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The kicker to this? Not only do the original posters SEE your name, but so do the people in their comment section, folks related to them should they interact with you, and so on.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Comment and Engage on your own stuff</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Ever wondered WHY I always comment and react to my own posts, as well as any comments I place in them?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>LinkedIn ensures that ANYONE and EVERYONE you're connected to can SEE what you comment and react to! This includes YOUR posts as well! You can capitalize on this on top of what I've previously mentioned in order to get some serious traction!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Post regularly</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>This might not come as a shocker, but YES, post REGULARLY!

What if I told you we could have something like that!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>What if I told you they could make all of that ACCESSIBLE and AFFORDABLE to you much like with HTB and TCM’s stuff? Do you still follow?! GOOD! Keep reading, it only gets better, PROMISE!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Part of Ex Machina's goal is to create a hackerspace where you can visit either PHYSICALLY or VIRTUALLY, and participate in their overall Cyber range, allowing you to grow as Hackers and Cyber Security professionals.</p> <p></p> <p>Essentially Ex Machina's goal is to turn the big TWO, HTB and TCM Security into the big THREE. There's no telling what's possible if they actually manage to pull this off? Not only will you be able to learn the basics from HTB and TCM, BUT, when you’re ready to begin APPLYING the knowledge, you’ll have Ex Machina to help you step up your game!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Imagine stuff like SEIM, SOAR, MITRE setups, even azure active directory stuff you'd probably need to purchase a subscription and a lot more, along with a ton of other stuff all accessible to you now! Imagine wanting to learn how to code, or get HANDS on training with Robotics, stuff you'd HAVE to spend A LOT of money on in order to even do the thing, also available to you now?! This also goes for PHYSICAL hacking tools and a lot more! Imagine all that being accessible to you in one or more PHYSICAL spaces! This is essentially what Hacker culture SHOULD feel like and is what they’re going for!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Oh, did I mention folks there are MEGA friendly and you’ll get CLOSE up guidance from them? That’s mentorship basically!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Wanna help them succeed? Well, their non-profit, so in other words, contribute what you can in order to ensure you as well as everyone else that needs PRACTICAL, both HANDS on as well as VIRTUAL training.

THAT, is what I mean by “centralized”.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is CVE-2023-22527? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>It's an RCE/RDP exploit that can be pulled off via OGNL injection which is a popular java based expression framework that can be found in the Confluence infrastructure.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The exploit takes advantage of the centralized aspect of the system, a SMB collective, that can be accessed by various companies that up and funnel all their data so they can share it with one another.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If a threat actor manages to leverage the system they'd be able to infect it with spoofed versions of the original that are obfuscated with malware, pivoting into a botnet and a lot more.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Metasploit? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Metasploit is an offensive security penetration testing framework that can be used for a variety of penetration testing methodologies: web application, networking, C&C/botneting, mobile hacking, etc. It’s a multi-tool power house in case you haven’t noticed, and has left a legacy, where tools like SET, routersploit and even kali nethunter mimic in terms of overall terminal functional and design. It also has one of the best well maintained database archives of any and all exploits that exist in its database. The code written and stored in it is beyond our deserving.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>In some cases it can be used to install malware on a system depending on how well the exploit is performed and the level of privileges on the system.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>You can learn more about Metasploit in one of my past articles here! Full Patreon exclusive video in full details that can be purchased from me if you want to learn all the PRACTICAL basics really quickly!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is MimiKatz? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p> MimiKatz is a beloved and commonly used tool for hackers to leverage various credentials on a system, specifically Windows ones, allowing them to do stuff like: privilege escalation, pass the hash, essentially uncovering any plain text files that would have credentials, allowing threat actors to gain admin rights. </p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is PDQ? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>It's essentially a tool that is used in order to install various files and software packages on a system.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Why's this bad? Well, for starters, if you manage to to leverage a system, you can install and upgrade any form of software you want on it remotely. In the hands of a threat actor you can infect a singular trusted system, even a redundant one, and install any and all needed tools, infecting a network even further as well as any SMB file shares it might contain like in this case.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is AnyDesk? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Ever heard of "TeamViewer"? AnyDesk is just another form of a commercial GUI based RDP tool that can be used to access another system, making it seamless to install any and all forms of malware on a system.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Remember that little bit on how I explained that Confluence data centers are centralized and HOW they can be compromised?</p> <p></p> <p>With AnyDesk, not only can you get a remote connection established to a system, BUT, you can also get a GUI based one, taking advantage of infrastructures that already use and or trust it in the process as well.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>With AnyDesk, not only can you get a remote connection established to a system, BUT, you can also get a GUI based one, taking advantage of infrastructures that already use and or trust it in the process as well.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Using anydesk allows you to: Check for sensitive files using mimikatz more accurately, input admin credentials and give permissions for them, run PDQ, and a lot more. Think of it like LITERALLY being able to not only see someone’s screen BUT, you’re able to control it as if you were there. The ultimate form of a pwned system.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is LockBit? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>LockBit is a form of data at rest symmetric encryption algorithm that's used in order to encrypt and secure all files on a windows file system, rendering it infeasible to threat actors that either remotely access the drive OR, physically by simply stealing it.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>This article was kind of hard to write, since I looked up to Heath Adams when I was in my earlier days as a hacker.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I spoke good faith about him MANY times, even featured him in some of my past articles for people that wanted to break into Cyber, but he dropped the ball on this one.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>He had the potential to become one of the greats when it came to Cyber Security training and industry certs. Now I have to take back what I said and revise a lot of that stuff.</p> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How is LockBit Ransomware? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Ransomware is essentially what LockBit does, BUT, with malicious intent!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Imagine if a threat actor leveraged your system and encrypted it without your consent, holding the key? THIS is what I mean. LockBit was basically used in a more malicious manner which becomes easily feasible ESPECIALLY more so since it's a "tool" already made that has access and can be used to accurately target files on the system, or the whole system itself.</p> </br></br> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What are SMB's? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>SMB's, a term commonly used for Windows file share systems, uses the FTP protocol to host an accessible file share server that can be accessed by various systems on either a local or remote network to access data.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Think of it like this, imagine you had all your: pictures, folders, documents, etc, and all of that was open and free via a port on your system to be shared with others remotely. This is what a SMB essentially is! SMB is again specifically a term for Windows based file shares, but overall these are classified as “FTP Services”, which stands for “File Transfer Protocol” service.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Rclone? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Rclone is what allowed threat actors to escavate files from all systems associated with the Confluence file share, syncing it to remote systems on their end, leaving the encrypted ones behind and the clean ones only with them, as well as the key they have.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>You can find out more about rclone here!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up!

If you have any further questions the best way to reach me is via my discord server.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/AttackTree.jpeg" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The CVE-2023-22527 Exploit 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p> After threat actors were able to successfully compromise Confluence data servers via OGNL injection and establish RCE to the data servers, they tried the most common initial commands to check if the had access to the server, stuff like: whoami(tells you the user name on the system), net(which shows file share servers mapped to the system on the network), etc. </p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Establishing a CLEAN shell 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I’ve mentioned this before in one of my past research articles, but one of the most common things threat actors like to do once they gain access to the system is setup a clean shell.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>As security professionals, one of our main concerns is to deter this. You see, you won’t ALWAYS prevent threat actors from gaining access, BUT, when or should they do, you want to render their access as infeasible as possible. Essentially, make their access useless.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Threat actors initially tried the classic old curl command to “wget” anydesk and run it on the system which initially failed, so they decided to use a windows binary program called “mshta” which is another means to retrieve the correct stagger they needed via metasploit in order to establish a CLEAN shell to the data server.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Access GRANTED 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Within the first 10 mins of compromising Confluence data servers, threat actors did and initial check of any and all processes running on the system.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Why? For starters: to check if there are any important processes on the system that could allow them to deal more damage to the system, to check if there are any security processes running on the system, and lastly, to check if anyone else has access to said system and boot them.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>It’s been assessed that prior access from other threat actors might have existed on the server, so threat actors decided to pull the plug on them to maintain clean access for themselves without any further disturbance.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Once everything was checked, they killed their own shell (in the process of said checks), connecting back to the system in order to create administrative accounts on the system, elevating their privileges.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Take Over 5 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A clever thing the threat actors did next, very fascinating, was they used the local account in order to RDP into admin areas of access, even going as far as to take advantage of the trusted system on the network they’ve compromised, leveraging SoftPerfects network scanner, using it against them.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>In simpler terms, they used their own security scanners against them to find all targets on the network, a trusted tool whose probes won’t be blocked on the network. This is what we would call Living off the land, where threat actors bypass detection systems by using ONLY what is trusted by the network itself.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>How do you defend against this? Well, it’s quite simple. Not every system should be trusted to do certain things. If you detect a system that has no need to run said scans, block the probes!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>How did they get the credentials to do this in case they might have needed it? Remember Mimikatz? Yeah, they used it in order to scope out and enumerate all needed credentials, allowing them to do anything they want with administrative privileges!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Rclone’s Turn 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Next, threat actors leveraged data backups by enumerating Veeam credentials via a powershell script, which allowed them to excavate all files from the server via Rclone, a tool designed to clone and transfer all files from a file system remotely.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Essentially they created their own File sharing server, and then cloned the files there using Rclone.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The LockBit Exploit 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Once threat actors fully cloned all the files from the server, the next thing they did was deploy the ransomware. They did this using LockBit against them, a FDE encryption at rest algorithm that encrypts all files on the system upon shutdown, preventing threat actors from utilizing said data.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>They did this in a clever way by leveraging PDQ, a deployment software system, in order to fully deploy the ransomware script via SMB file shares. That way whenever anyone accessed the SMB file share servers, they wouldn’t suspect a thing, executing the ransomware exploit!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>In total time the exploit took about 2 hours to complete!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Thanks for reading folks!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up!

I've talked a bit about it before in one of my previous posts, but figured I'd give a recap as well as some additional ideas that'll be cooking up. Some of them are already in rotation, so I'll indicate which one's are new, and which ones are already instated. </p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The DANGER! Series 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> </br></br> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/dangerseries.jpeg" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> <p>The Danger! Series is I raise more awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>This series includes a FREE 2 page article, the paid version being an additional page along with a long full in depth video (IF one is made for it).</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Exploit Guides (Patreon only) 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> </br></br> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/exploitseries.jpeg" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> <p>There's a difference between a simulation and the REAL deal!

    //When the spider button is called, it will write out the modal elements on the page for our pumpkin to define
    document.getElementById('testq').innerHTML = `<div class="modal-body" style = "text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">  <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/TheGoalOfFutabaWebs.png" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Synopsis 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p> Today's article is going to focus on talking a bit about the overall goal of my brand and what I intend to do with it. I’ve been a bit vague on that for a while now, often dropping breadcrumbs here and there, mostly due to not wanting to make empty promises, but considering how things are going so far and with some of my latest announcements, I figured now's the best time to discuss all of that with you. </p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">White Paper Research 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> One of the main aspects of my brand is the white paper research I develop, where I create article and video based material that focus on offensive security and many other skill traits I happen to possess that can be applied to “PRACTICAL” hacking on a fundamental level. It’s basically research material that can be more realistically applied to the real world vs most ethical material that tends to be on the simulated side of things. You could also say in a sense I’m taking simulated material and creating REAL world applications for it. I’m also designing a mentorship program that will help speed up the process on what people do and don’t need to know in order to get into Cyber Security, as well as get them ready for several certs all in one goal. This is long in development and won’t be available until another 4 or 5 years or so. It could be sooner depending on how things go. The goal of all of this is not to only be a form of revenue I can make by teaching and training up and coming Cyber Security professionals, but as a means to serve as a large scale portfolio that shows what I’m fully capable of. There’s also a sub category branch in here that’s going to feature some stuff that will focus on helping more women get into Cyber and tech overall as they’re mega underrepresented. </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Tool Development 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the things I’ll be focusing on in the long run will be tool development, ranging from a variety of custom software tools to aid penetration testers for exploitation development, as well as physical tools that can aid physical penetration testers.</p> <p></p> <p>In terms of the physical side of things, think of me as the more “gamified” version of what hack5 does. I’m modeling tools that are themed from some of my favorite video game series of all time while still being realistic enough to be applicable to the real world.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, one of my main ongoing projects is a custom penetration testing drone I’m working on that’s inspired from Watch Dogs 2.</p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Independent Contractor 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I haven’t spoken on this much until now, but one of the main end goals for me in the long run so I’m never in a situation where I’m out of work, is I want to become an independent contractor that provides penetration testing services and a variety of other things to people. You can find out more about the services I plan to provide on this page here for the company I’m currently partnered with to provide services through my brand.</p> <p></p> <p>It’s no shocker, but in today’s tech market ESPECIALLY for Cyber Security, you mustn't rely on an employer to give you a chance or keep you in Cyber. You need to do that yourself.</p> <p></p> <p>By having my own flow of contractor work, not only do I stay in the game and gain more experience, but I put myself in a situation where it presents more full time opportunities for me by networking me via contracts, BUT, I also am in a situation where I don’t have to rely on an employer to keep money in pocket. It’s a win win situation IF I play my cards right which I’ve been doing so far. It’s all a matter of perseverance and being patient.</p> <p></p> <p>I’m starting an official LLC soon so I’ll be able to provide said services on the book to people, as well as the many other services that have been talked about so far in my article.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Evil HERO Branch 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up!

Yes, of course. Absolutely they should provide this information to the public so they can look it over as well as various other auditors to verify if such information is true. Now I'm not talking about PRIVATE PRIVATE INFORMATION because that's a given no no, but overall when you design security products, or ANY product for that matter, you should wanna show the fruits of your labor.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I've been noticing a trend lately with Cyber Security firms, specifically new and upcoming ones trying to compete, where "tell" but don't "show". They'll claim they have the best detection system and that it outdoes many others, but when you ask them to SHOW you, they refuse to show you the results on a basic level. It's as if they simply want you to take you on their word and just buy the product, doing whatever it takes to prevent you from having some sort of sample or review of any kind, which is bad practice considering the fact it involves "Cyber Security", where 3rd party vendors have been known to ahem.... cause "breaches". You pick up what I'm putting down?</p> <p></p> <p>The laughable part? They take advantage of the fact most Cyber Security related services engagements are "Confidential" in order to get you to take their word for it. What do I mean by that? Ever been in an interview as someone's that worked in Cyber, but you couldn't really discuss what you specifically did there due to NDA's? Yeah that's what I mean by that.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Don't even get me started on how they exploit folks that don't understand much about Cyber in order to buy them into what they're selling.</p> <p></p> <p>The funny part about this is there are OBVIOUSLY ways to advertise what their products do and the overall results without breaching any form of NDA. How? I dunno???? Show us some test results and then actual feedback from places that ran said product?</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Leading By Example 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>What is a good example of what I mean by SHOWING? Wiz For example. Not only do they advertise a good product as well as other services, but they CONSTANTLY show you their overall competency through the intricate findings via their whitepaper security research they rep with pride. This can also be seen through the very employees that work there that show it off as well such as Stacey Lokey-Day for example. Not only does this generate interest in their products/services, but it opens a window of TRUST, where I can SEE the results.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>When you're confident in what you're selling, you'll never have issues showing people what your product is capable of.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I spoke good faith about him MANY times, even featured him in some of my past articles for people that wanted to break into Cyber, but he dropped the ball on this one.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>He had the potential to become one of the greats when it came to Cyber Security training and industry certs. Now I have to take back what I said and revise a lot of that stuff.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up!

You might even say that by the end of this article, you’ll also have an idea on HOW to properly read and analyze code altogether, which is an important skill set whether it be for Cyber, hacking, or areas like Software Engineering that MANY struggle with, more so since a lot of code typically is poorly documented, if any at all exits, which can be problematic for those that don’t know how to navigate the unknown without it. You shouldn’t have to of course, but in the wild, it’s what you’re going to see so it’s best to get good at it, more so if you're a security analyst and hacker overall. Threat actors aren't going detail how their stuff works. That's NONSENSE and would be silly!</p> <p></p> <p>* giggles while recalling my previous article *</p> <p></p> <p>It's not like Cyber Security professionals publicly do this on a daily basis right? RIGHT?</p> <p></p> <p>I’m going to explain how to analytically and strategically approach the unknown and figure out what makes it tick altogether, with a sample of some of the stuff I’m working on for my next series so you can easily follow along.</p> <p></p> <p>I’m also going to explain how to turn offense into defense which is something I’m really good at despite me NOT specializing in blue teaming.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Learn The Language 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>It’s a no brainer on this one…. But YES, LEARN…THE….LANGUAGE! Remember, you CAN reverse engineer and put two and two together, but you’re better off knowing the native language, otherwise you’ll not only have to research the language itself as you study it, but the code itself, on top of any unique techniques that might be embedded within the code. By simply being somewhat knowledgeable about the language first, from there, you can simply worry about studying the code for any vulnerabilities that might exist within it.</p> <p></p> <p>There are resources like W3 schools for example that can increase your level of literacy in a language depending on how experienced you are already with a programming language. For me this is about 12 hours per language to be prepped and ready in case I don't know the language.</p> <p></p> <p>Part of the main reason I know many programming languages is to avoid having to learn a new one. I'm literate in many already and can read and pick up as I go, which allows me to FOCUS on the analysis.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Break The System Apart 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the many benefits of studying code analysis, whether it be for vulnerability assessments or forensics malware analysis, is you get to “break” the system apart and see what makes it tick. This is where you get your hands dirty and REALLY get under the hood to properly understand how the system works.</p> <p></p> <p>Whether you be a threat actor or a professional who does things ethical offensively/defensively, This is a great opportunity to to learn, more so if you’re on the more offensive side of things, as you’ll not only be tasked with finding vulnerabilities and figuring out how to mitigate them, but threat modeling various attack vectors that are possible should a vulnerability exist within the code, meaning…. YOU GET HANDS ON EXPERIENCE CRAFTING EXPLOITS/SCENARIOS depending on which side you’re on which is the fun part. This also, of course, depends on the role you work for and overall responsibilities. This is also where you “learn” more complex programming techniques related to your area of choice in Cyber.</p> <p></p> <p>When you’re analyzing code, you want to get into the habit of breaking down each line of code at a time. Each line has a story to tell, and you might miss something if you overlook it no matter how simple it is.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, there was a set of JS code I was studying a while back for the new malware analysis series I’m working on. The code revolved around DOS’ing a server, but at a quick glance I assumed the way the code was behaving had much to do with overloading the web application server via HTTP requests only, HOWEVER, what I overlooked was memory overloads that were being used to crash the server. Each time the code ran, it behaved in a manner that would cause the server to store more and more memory which is unethical, which can lead to an eventual crash in the long run, more so since it is used for loops to enhance the process. For those that don’t know, using for loops consumes quite an amount of memory, and without proper memory deallocation techniques, with today’s modern processing power, you can crash a system in seconds.</p> <p></p> <p>By properly analyzing the code flow, I was able to both formulate a mitigation to the threat, as well as figuring out crafty ways to abuse the exploit.</p> <p></p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Document As You Go 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Many will love this, many will hate this, but DOCUMENT AS YOU GO! Each time you break the system apart, write comments next to each line. Get into the habit of that, as this will also teach you CLEAN programming habits in the overall long run.</p> <p></p> <p>It’s also a way for you to logically and algorithmically study the code flow, as well as leave “soft” bread crumbs that explain it to the next person that needs to read over your findings. This is also just, again, SMART practice! If you pull the comments apart, if you’ve been documenting everything properly, you’ll also already have a ton of documentation on the matter already, saving you time on writing the official documentation later on as you can simply extract from that.</p> <p></p> <p>How to properly document? Take a look at this quick sample of some of the code I’ve dissected for the first malware analysis I’m working on. THIS is what I mean by “breaking” the system apart, as well as documenting as you go. Each line is documented and thoroughly explained with my overall thought process, as well as being constructed with theories/hypotheses to further interpret the overall science behind the code.</p> </br></br> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/CodeSnippet1.png" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Exploit The Code 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Ever hear the saying “a good defense, makes a good offense”? Well… the same could be said in reverse ESPECIALLY when it comes to Cyber.</p> <p></p> <p>Regardless if you’re on defense, figuring out how to exploit something TELLS you HOW to defend something. I don’t specialize in blue teaming, BUT, because I’m exceptional when it comes to offense, I can figure out my defense from that.</p> <p></p> <p>I want you to go back to that snippet I made earlier. Remember how the comments focus on weaknesses I’m addressing in the code? You can take what you found and craft exploits with them. You can turn defense into offense, and offense into defense. You’ve just gotta be smart about HOW you go about it.</p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it.

A lot of what I’m going to say in this article might be obvious to some, but rest assured, IT’S NOT OBVIOUS to MANY that work in Cyber. If it were, then I myself, as well as well established professionals wouldn’t be “winking” or hinting at this time and time and time again.</p> <p></p> <p>We have all the means and tools available, even the information which is publicly available and FREE, however, what if that were the very problem itself and WHY we have such BAD Cyber Security practices to date.</p> <p></p> <p>Keep reading and you’ll find out exactly what I mean by that.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Public Disclosures Hurt Us 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> Ever see the latest news on MAJOR security breaches or recent white papers from security researches that get publicly disclosed online? Yeah, THIS, although that information is nice, is part of the problem as to WHY threat actors are constantly able to adapt and stay two steps ahead of us. It also gives threat actors INGENIOUS ideas on how to piggyback off of recent breaches and evolve them, sharing that information with each other. Don’t even get me started on “living off the land” stuff that becomes possible when we “talk” too much. When you disclose PUBLICLY HOW certain breaches took place or how to prevent them on a technical level, you’re telling threat actors STEP BY STEP on HOW to breach your security systems. It's even worse since we have DEDICATED platforms that help fill threat actors on all this juicy information. A good example of what I mean by this, and this is no insult to anyone, would be the beloved Wiz. As much as I LOVE Wiz and a lot of other Security focused places that disclose Security research information to everyone, time and time again I’ve been able to get full in depth information on recent exploit techniques, where, if I were a threat actor, could allow me to devise said exploits against other infrastructures. Even without places like Wiz that do all of this, it’s still mandated by law that breach disclosure occurs. Now…. how to handle disclosures? Well… to be rather blunt…. Sum it up as quick as possible. No need for a diagram and all that. I know this sounds bizarre, but hear me out. It’s the job of SECURITY professionals to break down and study HOW a breach took place with just an overall summary and devise mechanisms of their own in order to defend against it, even apply needed patches if necessary for all systems. This of course would REQUIRE companies to have a DEDICATED budget for proper Cyber Security procedures which most still sleep on. Now, what do I mean by “summing it up as quickly as possible”? Ever seen a CVE that just dropped and you tried replicating it but have no idea how? THIS is what I mean by that. The CVE simply explains HOW the breach occurs without full in depth information on to the tee things, leaving it up to Security professionals to test and check against it on their own and figure out how to defend against it, OR, if you’re a threat actor, figure out how to replicate the exploit (which threat actors aren’t too keen on sharing how to do since they profit off of selling that information). </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Lack of Emphasis on Security 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now, this isn’t a shocker to most folks that work in Cyber Security, but security is almost NEVER in mind for most business infrastructures</p> <p></p> <p>🎃When developing complex systems and software</p> <p></p> <p>🎃Budgets</p> <p></p> <p>🎃Competent teams</p> <p></p> <p>🎃Incident response</p> <p></p> <p>🎃Security Audits</p> <p></p> <p>🎃Penetration tests</p> <p></p> <p>And the list goes on.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;"> Lack of Security Talent 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now this might rub a few the wrong way.. BUT…. WE DO HAVE SHORTAGE OF CYBER SECURITY TALENT. Not by numbers, NO, there is plenty of that. The PROBLEM is we don’t have the RIGHT talent in the RIGHT places. We have people that SHOULD be in Cyber, NOT in Cyber, and people that shouldn't in Cyber if that makes sense.</p> <p></p> <p>Cyber Security isn’t a game, there’s A LOT on the line should an infrastructure FAIL to prevent a breach: reputational value, financial assets, and of course overall jobs that are on the line that can be impacted should financial assets be impacted from security breaches. Not even just the company itself, but the very end user data hosted in them puts said individuals at risk which can lead to stuff like identity theft and a lot more.</p> <p></p> <p>A consistent trend, as disappointed as I am to say this… Is we have folks in Cyber that don’t “understand” security. Most of them know how to regurgitate what they “know” on Security related subject matters, maybe even use a good chunk of the tools to defend, even attack if possible (if they even, since most pentests are being automated now a days), but this doesn’t mean they “understand” security.</p> <p></p> <p>A lot of this is due to the movement of not having to be “technical” to work in Cyber or over prioritization on “soft skills” which leads to a lot of folks that aren’t technical enough to apply basic to advanced Security frameworks/procedures, all of which is more prevalent when dealing with leadership roles like CISO’s for example. This leads to MANY recurring situations where security breaches, basic ones that can EASILY be prevented.</p> <p></p> <p>How to find the right talent? We already have. The problem is Cyber Security has become a celebrity thing where only the cool kids get into the club. It’s become less about security and more about ego.</p> <p></p> <p>It’s also problematic that budgets simply don’t “exist” for said talent if that makes sense, rather, a refusal to make them.</p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up!

I’m going to list a few, using the ones I specialize in as an example.</p> <p></p> <p>Oftentimes when people are trying to learn the basics of Hacking and Offensive Security it can be a bit intimidating as it can be a bit “broad”, which is WHY it’s one of the hardest areas to get into, often requiring people to start with Blue teaming before they truly dive into it. I’m going to narrow it down so it’s not as intimidating as it appears to be.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Network Penetration Testing/Network Security 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This is a form of Penetration Testing I’m VERY proficient in as I stem from a background focused on networking.</p> <p></p> <p>Network Penetration Testing involves breaching various network infrastructures, whether it be physically via the main access point itself: Tapping into physical ports, Evil Twining/Jamming, etc, OR, digitally, where you’re coming from an external standpoint such as web application penetration testing, to RCE your way in.</p> <p></p> <p>The goal is to infect an internal network in order to uncover various nodes(systems) that exist on the network, formulating a daisy chain known as a botnet, where you, the botmaster, control all the bots on the network in order to monitor all activity on the network, as well as cipher and excavate any important data. You can even control the bots like “zombies” where you can command them, as trusted systems, to execute various tasks or tools on your behalf, allowing you to go undetected from various security systems either on the system or the network itself.</p> <p></p> <p>Creating a botnet is your bread and butter as a Network Penetration Tester and is your END goal in the long run.</p> <p></p> <p>Network Penetration testing is also a skill set that goes hand in hand with the next Hacking variation I’m going to discuss next, rather, you’ll become more proficient in it if you pick that one up first.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;"> Web Application Pentesting 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This is one of the more beginner friendly areas for Ethical Hacking and Offensive Security. It’s where I started, and is usually where the most essential skill sets for Hacking are picked up.</p> <p></p> <p>Web Application Penetration revolves around you hacking Web Applications which are basically websites in simpler terms.</p> <p></p> <p>In order to become proficient in it you need to have proper Networking fundamentals in order to understand how the internet works, which in the long run, should you master it, will carry over to internal network penetration testing which is where you can deal the most damage.</p> <p></p> <p>You’ll learn stuff like:</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Proper information gathering techniques</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Enumeration</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Injection Techniques which are HIGHLY common</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Client/Server Side Exploits</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Fuzzing/Filter Bypassing</p> <p></p> <p>And one other thing I’ll talk about next, which is a GOOD skill set to have. If you’ve been following my articles then this next topic will make a lot of sense to you straight away.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;"> API Penetration Testing 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I’m exceptionally good at this, as I often dissect various core API’s on a daily basis to craft unique exploits.</p> <p></p> <p>API hacking involves you exploiting the automotive capabilities of automation programs.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, a classic one, Windows32 API hacking, which involves you exploiting all the various core function calls of the Windows Operating System on a kernel level. The core API for it allows you to write programs that can communicate with the system in various ways.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, I can exploit functions that manipulate memory pages in order to formulate DLL injection exploits, allowing me to deliver malicious code alongside a particular program that loads on the system when the end user clicks on it.</p> <p></p> <p>Most Web Applications have core API’s that constantly have to be tested, otherwise you can exploit them and pivot into advanced RCE exploits that can deal some serious damage.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Mobile Penetration Testing 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This involves exploiting various mobile end devices in order to infect them, leading into stuff like SSH tunneling which can allow you to connect the device back to a remote private server you control in order to do as you please.</p> <p></p> <p>The best place to start to get a handle on it would be the Metasploit Framework. I have material on it video wise that teaches you how to do stuff like: extract contacts, tap into video camera feeds, enable a recorder to capture audio for the device, and a lot more.</p> <p></p> <p>Mobile Device Penetration Testing, should you get good at it, will further expand your overall understanding of IoT and networking fundamentals, as well as core OS skills, as it’ll push you a bit further in order to get crafty with pulling them off.</p> <p></p> <p>You’ll also become more proficient at botnetting as you have to do clever stuff like setting up apache HTTP servers that can deliver the payload to the end device accordingly.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, you can host an apache server, combining it with Network Penetration Testing techniques such as DNS poisoning in order to trick end users into downloading and executing the payload needed to infect the mobile device. You can then further combine obfuscation techniques in order to go undetected from the devices security systems.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up!

It’s NOT an easy path, BUT, if you can get GOOD at it, then you’ll TRULY be able to learn on your own for FREE without anyone’s help!</p> <p></p> <p>I’m also going to address WHEN you would have to PAY in order to learn so you know how to properly spend your money should you need to do so. As much as I LOVE FREE learning, there are MANY cases where reasonable pay walls exist. NOT EVERYTHING IS FREE in life. I’ve had to learn this the hard way!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I make PAID content, but at the same time, I also want to encourage FREE learning as much as possible so people can LEARN how to THINK on their own and stand on their own power! It’s the main reason I write articles like this and give out as much advice as I can as possible and why I do what I do to give back to the Cyber Security community.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is FREE learning? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>FREE learning is just that, FREE! It requires ZERO money in order to learn. The only thing that IS required: is a computer, home internet, and the DISCIPLINE to learn on your OWN, emphasis on that last part! Technically you have to PAY in order to get these things, but I digress.</p> <p></p> <p>FREE learning is just another term for “Self-Taught”, which is common nowadays! A lot of people, when getting into Web Development was the new trend, were often commonly Self-Taught, myself included when I first started learning how to code. There were an ABUNDANCE of resources available online so it only made sense to teach yourself. Learning to code was no longer gatekeeped knowledge, so LITERALLY, ANYONE could learn how to code for FREE!</p> <p></p> <p>This is convenient for those that are unable to afford a FORMAL education from an institution with DIRECT guidance, where they can essentially learn all the SAME material on their own! This increases accessibility across the board!</p> <p></p> <p>HOWEVER, it did create one fatal drawback, which I’ll discuss later on over the course of this article.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Should FREE learning exist? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Anyone should be able to pick up a book or a computer and have the ability to learn on their own and at their own pace! It’s a human right!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How to Go About FREE Learning? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The best way to go about it is to get into the habit of filtering through information.</p> <p></p> <p>In case you haven’t noticed this about me by now… I AM GOOD at filtering through what I NEED to know Vs what I DO NOT need to know.</p> <p></p> <p>A lot of people struggle with this, even experienced professionals, but if you can get GOOD at this, then you’ll progress rather quickly.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The DrawBacks of FREE Learning? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I’ve talked about the BENEFITS of FREE learning, but now let’s dive into the DRAWBACKS of it!</p> <p></p> <p>For starters…. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN! You only have access to what you can find in order to learn, which there is PLENTY of!</p> <p></p> <p>“But Futaba if that’s the case, then why is that a DRAWBACK?!?! There are PLENTY of FREE material online for me to learn from so I-”</p> <p></p> <p>OBJECTION!!!</p> <p></p> <p>I think you haven’t been paying CLOSE attention to when I’ve stated “ON YOUR OWN”!” That’s right…. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN, as in SOLO, NO HELP from ANYONE! No one’s holding your hand so you LITERALLY have to sit down and FIGURE IT OUT on your OWN!</p> <p></p> <p>THIS!!! is the BIGGEST drawback to FREE learning, ESPECIALLY, when it involves Cyber Security which is HUGE in and of itself!!!!!!</p> <p></p> <p>When I first started learning about Cyber Security on my OWN, I had NO IDEA what I was doing or where I was going. NO ONE pointed out ANYTHING as to where I needed to go career wise. I had to sit down and figure it out! Even with ALL the FREE resources out there I was still running around with my head chopped off not knowing what the hell I was doing for YEARS!!</p> <p></p> <p>WHY? Well, let me elaborate with this next point!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Mentorship is NOT FREE! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Although FREE learning should exist, it does NOT mean however that FREE guidance should exist. You can’t have your cake and eat it too!</p> <p></p> <p>The price you pay for FREE learning is NO FREE MENTORSHIP or guidance.</p> <p></p> <p>“BUT THAT’S NOT FAIR THE KNOWLEDGE SHOULD BE FREE!”</p> <p></p> <p>Here’s the thing…. IT IS FREE!!! It’s EVERYWHERE!!! HOWEVER, what is NOT FREE, is expecting FREE labor AKA mentoring/tutoring from people. You have to be mindful, mentoring IS A FORM OF LABOR, labor which is NOT FREE. There are people out there that give back to the community which is nice, but you’re NOT entitled to it!</p> <p></p> <p>This might rub A LOT of people the WRONG way, but ask yourself this question, would YOU do it for FREE?</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">When Should You Have to Pay? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>It’s a no brainer on this one, but, like I’ve stated, when you’re looking for direct guidance from someone, OR, if you’re of course looking to acquire TOOLS/SOFTWARE to enhance your learning experience.</p> <p></p> <p>Also… as I’ve stated, there are MANY niche sources of knowledge, or QUALITY material, like from HackTheBox or TCM for example, where the only way to acquire it is through PAID methods. No one’s going to hand you what they purchased for FREE so don’t even think it works like that! I want their research content as well, but sadly, even I know in order for me to acquire it I would HAVE to pay for it.</p> <p></p> <p>Going back to the tools/software thing, yes, physical tools like the wifi-pineapple, AREN’T FREE. You have to PAY for them! Even things I’ve mentioned earlier: PC gear, internet, etc, all these things, in order for you to START learning for FREE, REQUIRE that you PAY for them FIRST!</p> <p></p> <p>Advanced IDS systems that you can use to build homelabs, oftentimes some of them are both hardware and software, which require you to PAY, hence most people can’t get hands-on experience with A LOT of this stuff unless they work for a company that has it.</p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it. Just know the more you support my content the more there is in stored!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>- The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸</p> </br></br> </div>`;

It’s rather simple. The PROBLEM, like all things, is that people, REALLY intelligent people, lack the proper soft skills to explain it correctly to you.</p> <p></p> <p>Over the course of this article I’m going to use non-conventional and more fun ways to properly break down subnetting to you so it “clicks”.</p> <p></p> <p>It is ESSENTIAL that you UNDERSTAND subnetting as it also comes into play for offensive security when you have to navigate and find all the subnets that exist on a network to see where you can extend your attack surface. I am EXCEPTIONAL at this, as I not only have a full understanding of how subnetting and IP ranges work, BUT, I can “visualize” where I am, as well as make EFFECTIVE usage of basic commands that are commonly overlooked that TELL you how many subnets you have.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Subnetting? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Subnetting is the art of “splitting” a network into “subnetworks”, which is a network of networks.</p> <p></p> <p>Here’s a diagram in order to better visualize it.</p> </br></br> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/SubnettingForDummies.webp" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> <p>The top of the tree is the “core” network, the main AP that serves as the “exit node” or default gateway which is where all network traffic is routed to and from the network.</p> <p></p> <p>The sub trees that you see below are the “subnets”. Ignore the ones below the subnets for now as that’s a bit complicated like explaining recursion. The goal is to keep it simple so you can follow along!</p> <p></p> <p>Subnets have what is known as a “subnet mask”, the “/24” that you see commonly attached to a subnet IP address.</p> <p></p> <p>Ex: “192.168.1.1/24”</p> <p></p> <p>By default, this is the standard subnet mask that is usually assigned to you on a network.</p> <p></p> <p>If you apply subnetting you might see stuff like</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 “192.168.1.1/23”</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 “192.168.1.1/22”</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 “192.168.1.1/21”</p> <p></p> <p>And so forth. HOWEVER, be mindful THEY ARE NOT THE SAME SUBNET! The “subnet mask” is there to tell you which subnet a system belongs to on a network. Of course, many have differentiating IP addresses to tell the apart for simplicity's sake. It can vary.</p> <p></p> <p>You also have stuff like “IP Addresses Classes”, Class A, Class B, Class C, etc.</p> <p></p> <p>“OH MY GOD THAT’S SOOOO COMPLICATED” Nahh, not really haha. Classes define the “range pool” of IP addresses that you have available to dish out to systems on the network.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, IP Ranges that might look like</p> <p></p> <p>“192.168.1.0-255” indicate there is an available pool of 255 IP addresses, the final number being reserved for what is known as the “broadcast address” that is used to echo messages to all systems on the network should you choose to do so, and of course, the first one, which is reserved for the default gateway. You can of course configure these however you like, but it’s kept default for simplicity's sake.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How Does Subnetting Apply To Cyber Security? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The goal of subnetting is to obfuscate your defenses and avoid what is known as a “monolithic structure”, borrowed from the concept of containers which condense all dependencies for software into one “container”. For Software engineering, this is good practice. HOWEVER, for Cyber Security, this is BAD practice.</p> <p></p> <p>When you condense EVERYTHING into one place, you not only create, become a single point of failure, where should an attacker, such as myself, breach your internal network, EVERYTHING is compromised. Imagine I attack one system, and EVERYTHING goes down with it.</p> </br></br> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/SpecialistVsGeneralist.jpeg" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Synopsis 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p> Today’s article is going to focus on an interesting topic in tech, one that carries over to Cyber Security as well, Specialist VS Generalist. You’ve seen time and time again heated debates on whether or not one should be a specialist or a generalist regardless of what field they pursue in tech: Software Engineering, Cyber Security, IT, etc. I’m going to compare and contrast the two in order to fundamentally deduce which of the two is ultimately better, in my opinion that is. Feel free to disagree and leave your overall opinions in the comments section below. </p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What Is a Specialist? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Specialists are those that focus on ONE particular area in tech, the many skill sets that pertain to said area.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, you might have heard of the term of a “full stack” web developer where they have a certain stack they specialize in for the kind of web applications they specialize in developing</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 HTML</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 CSS</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 JavaScript</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Python (Django for example)</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 SQL</p> <p></p> <p>And the list goes on.</p> <p></p> <p>Another example, and this goes within the realm of those that specialize in offensive security such as penetration testing for example, would be the “types” of penetration testers that exist: network penetration testers, WAP penetration testing, API penetration testers, etc.</p> <p></p> <p>Typically, when it comes to Cyber Security, people often specialize in ONE particular area on the spectrum for whatever area it is they prefer, whether it be: blue teaming, red teaming, purple teaming, even people that specialize as a Gray Hat hacker such as myself for example.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Pros to Being a Specialist? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The obvious PRO to being a specialist is that you SPECIALIZE within that domain! You’re an expert at it!</p> <p></p> <p>Another MAJOR benefit, although this is a bit controversial, is you have “less” to learn/focus on. I know this one will TRIGGER many, but hear me out on this one.</p> <p></p> <p>When it comes down to a generalist vs a specialist, the BIGGEST difference is the overall learning curve and amount of stuff you NEED to know and keep up with. Generalists are BROAD and all over the place, meaning they have A LOT to keep up with, whereas, compared to specialists, they just have to stick to whatever stack or area’s/tool-sets they specialize in and that's it.</p> <p></p> <p>This is WHY, whenever people say offensive security is HARD to get into, which it is, it’s because of the aspect of having to be a generalist, where your skill sets need to be diverse, which can be difficult and time consuming to master. You’ve seen how BROAD my skill sets are right? It took me YEARS to learn and MASTER all that I know and I haven’t even scratched the surface yet.

You’ve seen time and time again heated debates on whether or not one should be a specialist or a generalist regardless of what field they pursue in tech: Software Engineering, Cyber Security, IT, etc. I’m going to compare and contrast the two in order to fundamentally deduce which of the two is ultimately better, in my opinion that is. Feel free to disagree and leave your overall opinions in the comments section below. </p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What Is a Specialist? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Specialists are those that focus on ONE particular area in tech, the many skill sets that pertain to said area.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, you might have heard of the term of a “full stack” web developer where they have a certain stack they specialize in for the kind of web applications they specialize in developing</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 HTML</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 CSS</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 JavaScript</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Python (Django for example)</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 SQL</p> <p></p> <p>And the list goes on.</p> <p></p> <p>Another example, and this goes within the realm of those that specialize in offensive security such as penetration testing for example, would be the “types” of penetration testers that exist: network penetration testers, WAP penetration testing, API penetration testers, etc.</p> <p></p> <p>Typically, when it comes to Cyber Security, people often specialize in ONE particular area on the spectrum for whatever area it is they prefer, whether it be: blue teaming, red teaming, purple teaming, even people that specialize as a Gray Hat hacker such as myself for example.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Pros to Being a Specialist? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The obvious PRO to being a specialist is that you SPECIALIZE within that domain! You’re an expert at it!</p> <p></p> <p>Another MAJOR benefit, although this is a bit controversial, is you have “less” to learn/focus on. I know this one will TRIGGER many, but hear me out on this one.</p> <p></p> <p>When it comes down to a generalist vs a specialist, the BIGGEST difference is the overall learning curve and amount of stuff you NEED to know and keep up with. Generalists are BROAD and all over the place, meaning they have A LOT to keep up with, whereas, compared to specialists, they just have to stick to whatever stack or area’s/tool-sets they specialize in and that's it.</p> <p></p> <p>This is WHY, whenever people say offensive security is HARD to get into, which it is, it’s because of the aspect of having to be a generalist, where your skill sets need to be diverse, which can be difficult and time consuming to master. You’ve seen how BROAD my skill sets are right? It took me YEARS to learn and MASTER all that I know and I haven’t even scratched the surface yet. It’s the price you pay for being a generalist You can’t be good at EVERYTHING, HOWEVER, in trying to do so, you risk being overloaded with A LOT you need to know and be familiar/proficient with.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What Is a Generalist? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Generalists are people such as myself that tend to have a broad and diversified skill set.</p> <p></p> <p>Ever read up on some of my articles as well as my overall skillets and asked yourself “how the f**k does he know all this sh*t?” Yeah, that’s what I mean by being a specialist.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Pros to Being Versatile? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The BIGGEST pro to being a generalist is you have the right “tool” for every situation you might find yourself in, increasing your odds of success during many complex situations.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, during one of my CTF runs against some folks, part of the reason I was able to solve the “FindMe” challenge that’s also hosted on my custom CTF server, was because I had the following skill sets</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Reverse Engineering</p> <p></p> <p>🎃Malware analysis skills</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Code Review Skills</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Scripting Skills</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Forensics skills</p> <p></p> <p>And the list goes on.

This article is gonna be a short one and might also be of use to some folks in my network that might want to get into mentoring themselves, as it’s a solid way to hone your knowledge and skills, passing it onto the next person. I’ve been mentoring for roughly 5 years now, so I think it’s safe to say I have some solid experience under my belt.</p> <p></p> <p>but I‘ve never really clarified on HOW to be a GOOD one. Ever heard the phrase “There is no bad student, only bad teacher”? WELL… this is 99 percent true to a HIGH degree, more so coming from someone that’s autistic/neurodivergent.</p> <p></p> <p>Most people, even if they’re highly capable Cyber Security professionals or at whatever it is they do for a living, AREN’T fit to be teachers/mentors. You’ll understand what I mean by that as you continue reading the article.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Understanding the Student 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the biggest issues as to WHY most people aren’t good mentors/teachers is because they LACK the ability to understand their students. This is crucial when teaching someone as each individual learns in a UNIQUE manner, ESPECIALLY if they happen to be autistic/neurodivergent like me.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, due to my Visualspatial IQ, I’m a VISUAL learner, on top of being a low level and logical thinker. In order for me to properly understand what it is you’re teaching me, you NEED to provide a more visual example to me as well as explain it in FULL detail, which leads to my next point.</p> <p></p> <p>Fun fact before I move on, but did you know I FAILED out of all my programming courses when I was new to them simply because of this major issue? It wasn’t just me but 90 percent of the students in all my classes as well. It made me lose confidence in my ability to learn programming as well as pursue tech. When I started teaching myself how to code thanks to “The New Boston” who TAUGHT me how to code, I realized the issue wasn’t me, but the teachers I had, where his videos explained EVERYTHING in full detail. Stuff like while loops which went over my head, became easier and made sense, which allowed me to progress and realize, NO, I’M EXTREMELY GIFTED at programming. Even now I could code circles around most of my old professors whose classes I failed out of haha.</p> <p></p> <p>Fun fact, my teaching style stems from “The New Boston”.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">EXPLAIN IN FULL DETAIL! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now this might be MEGA OBVIOUS, but YES, PLEASE, FOR ALL THAT IS PURE, EXPLAIN EVERYTHING IN FULL DETAIL. I’M LOOKING AT YOU MATH TEACHERS!!!!! You’d be surprised how A LOT of complex subject matters aren’t as hard as we make them out to be.</p> <p></p> <p>One of the saddest realities of being really “smart” or really “good” at something is we “forget” that not everyone knows what we know. This can be problematic if you forget to explain all the little details of what it is you’re teaching. The only time you should EVER assume a student should know something is unless you’ve listed it as PRE-REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE BEFOREHAND, otherwise, you explain it in FULL detail.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, my articles. I’m not sure if you’ve noticed, but I explain EVERYTHING in FULL detail even if the reader might already KNOW what I’m talking about. This can be annoying to some, HOWEVER, I’m FULLY aware that not everyone knows what I know, so as such, I break it down in a manner where everyone can follow along, even highlighting some stuff that more advanced readers might have known.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>- The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸</p> </br></br> </div>`;

Remember how I said I’d eventually cover OOP (Object Oriented Programming)?.... Well… THE TIME HAS FINALLY COME! Object oriented programming, as much as many folks (except for me shockingly haha) hate, IT’S A REQUIRED skill and knowledge set ESPECIALLY if you plan to be a Software engineer or read ANY form of code in general. I kid you not, NOT knowing OOP will lock you out of being able to read 99 percent of modern code today. It’s EVERYWHERE so it’s CRUCIAL you understand it.</p> <p></p> <p>For today’s article, instead of teaching it via conventional analogies and methods, I’m going to mix it up a bit and do it my own way. I’m also going to simplify and elaborate on stuff like Polymorphism as well. I’m going to stick to the more general stuff that’s seen in many languages that feature some form of OOP. I’ll even talk about stuff like methods which is Javascripts supposed “answer” or “version” of OOP in a sense (although they still feature it in C++ fashion shockingly).</p> <p></p> <p>Sit back, relax, and prepare to embrace how something is so complicated… CAN BE REALLY SO SIMPLE HAHA.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is OOP? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>OOP, which stands for Object Oriented Programming, is just basically a way to model custom functions that you can call and use around in your code. It simplifies the complexity and time consuming need to re-write complex programming algorithms from scratch, making your life easier. A perfect example of what I mean by that would be modules like with Python, were you can just “import’ or “include” something and you just call an “object” for it and you’re good to go.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, (DOWNLOAD THE IMAGE IF IT'S TOO SMALL FOR YOU)</p> </br></br> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/pythoncode.png" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> <p> Without OOP, you’d have to build ALL, and I mean ALL of this from scratch over and over and over again.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is OOP (Members)? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>You’ve probably seen me mention something about “members” that belong to a class, where you can “call them” and use any that are available to you. Members are basically the overall functions that make up classes and can even be made available to other classes that need them via “Polymorphism”, which is a fancy term for “inheritance”, which is where other classes you’ve written “inherit” functions belonging to other classes you have Think of it like “biology”, where you “inherit’ dominant and recessive traits stemming from your parents.</p> <p></p> <p>Here’s an example to put it better into perspective for you. I’m going with C++ on this one since it’s THE BEST example one can give on the matter</p> </br></br> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/cppcode1.png" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/cppcode2.png" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> <img class = "img-thumbnail mt-4 Modal_Pic_Ransomware" src = "Images/cppcode3.png" style = "border-color: violet; background-color: indigo; height: 250px;"> </br></br> <p>I hope this little light hearted lesson on what OOP is helped you out a ton.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>- The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸</p> </br></br> </div>`;

Certifications Vs Experience, specifically, which of the two matter more, and which one will land you a job in Cyber. We go back and forth on the matter, but we never really sit down and “think” about the benefits and drawbacks of both, and whether not one or the other is better… OR both!</p> <p></p> <p>Over the course of this article I’m going to highlight the benefits and drawbacks of both, comparing the two in order to ultimately decide which one is better. Be mindful, this is just my overall opinion and you are free to disagree with me if you like. Also be mindful, a lot of what I’m going to talk about will also carry over to other areas of tech besides Cyber, so do pay close attention to all of what I’m about to say.</p> <p></p> <p>Also, like always, pay CLOSE attention to the way I “word” the overall article. You’ll get tripped up a lot if you don’t pay attention to the way I compare the two. In other words, PUT YOUR THINKING CAP ON!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What Are Certifications? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Certifications are the highlights of your knowledge on a particular domain within Cyber Security and contain the fundamental knowledge for you to pursue that particular area. They PROVE whether you have the sufficient knowledge to begin applying it.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, the CySA+ cert is the fundamental one for if you are pursuing a field in Cyber Security as a Cyber Security Analyst. It contains all the basic and advanced terminology you’ll see in the domain that you need to be familiar with, as well as knowledge on all the tools and frameworks you need to know before you get hands-on experience with it. Passing the exam indicates you are READY to apply to it!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Benefits of Certs? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Certifications serve you well in the long run, much like degrees (I know they’re hot garbage now haha), allowing you to meet the essential prerequisites for employers to even look at your resume when submitting a job application. Without them, you’ll be 10000 percent rejected on the fly as most AI/ATS systems filter you out simply for not having it.</p> <p></p> <p>You also become a PRIORITY over those that ONLY have experience, a common thing I’ve experienced myself when applying for jobs in Cyber, jobs I’m PLENTY qualified to do, which is the main reason I’m now going for them as well as my degree through WGU’s bachelors degree program.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Drawbacks Of Certs? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> They don’t necessarily mean you have the equivalent hands on experience nor do you understand the material on a fundamental level that is often required. They’re typically just multiple choice questions you answer looks at Comptia. They also cost A LOT OF MONEY and lock people that aren’t financially able to go for them like myself and many others. This is a HUGE problem, which is the main reason why they’re slowly chiseling out as a major priority for job requirements. </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Which Certs to Go For? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Go for certifications that are PERMANENT! Comptia ones are trash and require you to annually renew them each year, PER cert. Certs from HackTheBox - Dr. AITH as well as OffSec. Once you pass them you’ll never have to retake or re-certify them. That, and they are HIGH In demand and will actually land you a job cert alone!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Benefits Of Experience 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The overall benefits of experience, is that well… it’s EXPERIENCE, meaning you’ve not only learned the material, such as myself and many other self-taught folks, but have APPLIED the material, which is a HUGE problem with most cert holders today.</p> <p></p> <p>Experience can come in a variety of types: on the job experience, personal experience like projects and home labs, etc etc. How you get it, and the QUALITY of it, depend on how you go about it.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Drawbacks of ONLY Having Experience? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> As I’ve stated before, even if you have experience, if you don’t meet the degree/cert requirement, you’ll often be less favorable to employers. In their eyes, CERTS matter more and define your overall skill level… OR DO THEY!? </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Which is Better? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> Overall Experience is better and will CURB stomp ANYONE that is simply only holding a cert. I’ve talked about this before, but I’ve done a few CTF competitions with cert holders, and yeah… ahem…. A LOT OF THEM WERE STRAIGHT TRASH! Couldn’t run a few basic lines of Linux commands even if you had it set out in front of them. It’s a HUGE problem, and is the MAIN reason why the hiring process for Cyber is now favoring ACTUAL SKILLS vs having certs/degrees, the degree requirement soon to be a thing of the past. Overall, to maximize your effectiveness in the overall job market, try pursuing both, as it’s what I and a lot of other experienced professionals are already doing, which is now possible and affordable due to WGU’s Cyber Security degree program.

This article is going to be a bit on the 5 to 6 min read side so do be warned!</p> <p></p> <p>I’m also going to further elaborate on WHY I identify as a “Gray Hat” Hacker, something I’ve mentioned before but never really dived into much which plays a HUGE role in explaining the overall premise of this article. I’ll brush up on what a Gray Hat Hacker is so that anyone reading this can follow along smoothly, as well as leaving a link to the various Hat Archetypes that define each hacker and their overall purpose.</p> <p></p> <p>Most people when they’re looking to get into Hacking/Cyber Security their overall purpose is to either do it for fun or to pursue it as a professional career. Usually it’s a mixture of the two which is also part of the main reason I do it. HOWEVER, like I’ve stated in the main premise, there’s another hidden reason I do this, and why my skill sets are so broad for what they are.</p> <p></p> <p>I want you to pay CLOSE attention to the title of this article, as it’s symbolic and serves a purpose.</p> <p></p> <p>Fair warning before I begin, this article will contain SENSITIVE topics that might be faint for the heart, so feel free to click off this if this ain’t your cup of tea. I want to experiment with writing articles that address real world matters and how Hacking/Cyber Security applies to it, rather, what we can do as Hackers/Cyber Security professionals to address it.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a Gray Hat Hacker? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Gray Hat Hackers are a mixture of quality traits between White Hat Hackers, whom are good guys, and Black Hat Hackers, whom are bad guys, incorporating a series of ethical and unethical means in order to achieve their objective which tends to be more along the lines of “Hacktivism” for a greater cause or purpose. To put it into better perspective, they are GOOD guys that aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty, hence being in the gray area swaying either way. Their skill sets also tend to be a bit broad while having a certain niche.</p> <p></p> <p>A PERFECT example of one would be the infamous “Anonymous” group, where they target a lot of terrorist groups and corrupt organizations and expose them for the betterment of the world! They do whatever it takes to get the job done incorporating a wide variety of techniques, which allows them to achieve feats the ordinary Hacker/Cyber Security professional might have never thought were possible.</p> <p></p> <p>Be mindful, although Gray Hats aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty and will do ANYTHING to get the job done, they don’t usually resort to killing, as they tend to be more on the pacifist side, not ALL, but most in general.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Hunter Hunter 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I’ve talked about this before in my “The One Above All” article, but one of the main reasons why hackers do what they do is because THEY LOVE the THRILL of the hunt. What it is they like to hunt depends on the hacker which will greatly influence the skill sets they possess.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, CTF players that hack on a comptetional level, love the overall thrill of finding the exploit to secure the flag which tests the full limits of their capabilities. It’s exhilarating knowing you’ve pwned a system and have TOTAL control over it, as well as the many secrets it possesses. It’s even more exhilarating if you apply it on an unethical level and dabble in what you shouldn’t (I’m NOT encouraging you to do this!)</p> <p></p> <p>In this case, since we’re talking about Gray Hats, the thrill of the hunt for us is hunting whatever it is we’re most passionate about when it comes to activism.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Why I Became A Hacker? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The main reason I became a Hacker as well as a Cyber Security professional is to assist organizations that help track down and stop human trafficking operations, as well as anything along the lines of CSAM content distribution and a lot more. In other words….. I HUNT PREDATORS AND AM OBSESSED WITH DOING SO! If you would like to find out more about what CSAM is and why I fight against it check out one of my articles in the main catalog. I wrote it a while back to help raise awareness for how end to end encryption assists Child Predators online.</p> <p></p> <p>Although there are MANY things I would do to a predator if one were presented in front of me… I need a way to get my hands dirty while keeping it ethical! By working with organizations, even ghost ones for example that assist law enforcement, I can do just that, creating a world safer for women and children, most of which are the main target for these forms of operations.</p> <p></p> <p>There are also many other areas of activism I fancy such as hunt</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Hunting scammers (I’m looking at you JOB SCAMMERS)</p> <p></p> <p>🎃 Hunting domestic violence perpetrators</p> <p></p> <p>and a lot more.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What Inspired me to Hunt Predators? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I’ve talked about this before, but my best friend was almost a victim of sexual assault and a lot more, where her step father abused her and put her in situations no little girl should have to go through, her mother being one of the many bystanders that allowed this to happen. There’s an inspirational I made you should check out if you wanna hear my view points on why we need to teach children how to protect themselves online. Link to it can be found in the advanced format for this article on both Desktop and mobile. </p> <p></p> <p>A lot of Child predators exist among us, most of which go unnoticed since their targets are usually those that are unable to defend themselves and or unable to tell when they’re being taken advantage of. There are also groups of people, usually on the dark net, that create content and distribute it amongst themselves as some sort of fetish party, often getting away with it due to various protocols such as the TOR onion one that assist in protecting their anonymity online.</p> <p></p> <p>By hunting predators and exposing their identities as well as how they are able to do what they do, I aim to help clean up the internet and help make it a safer place for Children online. All of this, of course, could also apply to what I’ve stated before about help fighting human traffic operations.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Evil HERO 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The Evil HERO is a side brand that I’ll be launching in the near future that focuses on partnering with organizations that help combat the things I’ve talked about in this article. It is symbolic for a HERO, or rather, an Anti-HERO that is willing to do whatever it takes in order to fight predatory activities.</p> <p></p> <p>I’ll be having side content that will strictly be there, focusing on news and updates regarding various predatory activities and what we can do to stop them.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up!

They recently announced that from this moment forward, game developers are REQUIRED to disclose whether or not their game REQUIRES kernel level Anti-Cheat software. This is critical from both a competitive gaming standpoint, as well as a security standpoint.</p> <p></p> <p>This article was inspired by Stacey Lokey-Day who brought up the matter in her latest video that just dropped today! I’ll leave a comment for it in the comment section below!</p> <p></p> <p>The goal for today’s article is to explain WHY they now require game developers to disclose this information, as well as the overall dangers of allowing ANY form of software to have said level of access to your system. It’s not often talked about enough, but the level of access you give applications on your system can be something threat actors take advantage of to compromise a system.</p> <p></p> <p>I’m also going to dive into what a Kernel is so that you can easily follow along and UNDERSTAND why they’re now implementing this!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Kernel 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>You hear this term thrown around a lot, but not many really dive into the specifics of what a kernel is.</p> <p></p> <p>A Kernel is the overall biological makeup of an Operating System which dictates any and all hardware/software calls on the system, allowing them to communicate with one another.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, when you enter a keystroke on your keyboard, there are virtual key functions programmed on the lowest level of the system that read your input, the binary data, which is then converted to output, the text that you see on the screen. Keyboard injections for example, manipulate the Virtual keys of the system in order to have it execute tasks for rubber ducky exploits. Even stuff like: hitting the power button, pressing the eject button on the CD tray, EVERYTHING, is a part of the kernel and is a function call that belongs to the original programming of the OS system.</p> <p></p> <p>Another example, although this is not considered a kernel, would be an API, which is a program that is designed to automate a specific task: ChatGPT API, Windows API, etc. You can write code that controls the API, which if, depending on the API itself like the Windows one for example, would allow you to not only control the core functions of said software it was designed for, BUT, the kernel of the system itself!</p> <p></p> <p>Another way to think of a kernel would be all the function calls that exist in your program that you wrote which are callable at any time during execution of the program. Does that make sense?</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Kernel Level Access 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> Now that you know what kernel is, let’s dive into what Kernel access is and what it means when you give a program access to that level of privilege on your system. Kernel level access is just that, the highest level of privilege you can achieve on a system. Everything I just mentioned about kernels, when you give a program access to it, should threat actors compromise anything on your system that has that level of access, they can do whatever they want with your system. It can even allow seamless backdoor access for hackers if they wanted to install one on your system. </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What Does This Have to do with CrowdStrike? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>CrowdStrike was a PERFECT example of WHY you shouldn’t allow kernel level access, which is WHY Stacey brought it up in her video!</p> <p></p> <p>Because CrowdStrike allowed Kernel level access, any software failures that could have lead to registered hardware/software crashes which did happen, was plausible due to this level of access, causing a widespread of blue screens of deaths that LITERALLY shut down 8.5 millions of systems, DOSing many as well as causing issues with data mirroring that might have been in place and a lot more. For medical systems, if any of them were tied to life support, this would mean the death of many that were put on it.</p> <p></p> <p>The level of access you give an application to a system DOES matter and could be the very thing that causes a security breach!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up!

I spoke before on “How to become a Hacker”, but never really elaborated on what defines a SKILLED one on a fundamental level! Be mindful, and I KNOW this might scratch a few heads, I AM ONLY TALKING ABOUT HACKERS! NOW CYBER SECURITY PROFESSIONALS! HOWEVER, you can take what you will from this and apply it to being a GOOD Cyber Security professional for example.</p> <p></p> <p>For the sake of this article, to prevent bickering, I’m going to focus neither on “tools” nor “manual” technical skills, focusing more on the overall aptitude of a hacker, skill sets and traits they overall possess.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Their IQ 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>You hear this term thrown around a lot: General IQ, Emotional IQ, even stuff like Visual Spatial IQ which is EXTREMELY rare and so happens to be the one that I possess, allowing me to solve EXTREMELY complex problems and visualize everything on a low level in my head BEFORE I solve it PHYSICALLY. But… What EXACTLY does one’s IQ mean definitively?</p> <p></p> <p>One’s IQ relates to how well one applies what they know, and of course, how quickly they can pick stuff up.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, let’s say I taught each one of you how to write a backdoor exploit in Python, THE EXACT SAME ONE, and then asked all of you to show me how you would pull off the exploit and how you would upgrade the code for it? The person that uses it better and applies it with more finesse is obviously the smarter hacker.</p> <p></p> <p>Part of being a good hacker is relying on your overall smarts and strategy to exploit systems or learn them.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">They’re Ingenious 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>VERY skilled hackers are ingenious! They’re always thinking outside of the box which allows them to stay several steps ahead of their adversary, maintaining the element of surprise, which is important when you’re trying to breach complex systems with security in place.</p> <p></p> <p>A good example of what I mean would be some of my insights on Hacking/Cyber related matters, where I explain the various flaws of a system and how they can be exploited on a fundamental level.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, my previous article where I talked about the dangers of the Claude AI that emulates keystrokes on a system to pretend it’s a real user.</p> <p></p> <p>On a basic level, you can write a simple keylogger with it… HOWEVER.. It’s possible to formulate metamorphic malware and a lot more if you got really crafty under the hood. All you need to do is get a bit more ingenious and you’ll go far as a hacker!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">They’re Ingenious 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Hackers are PERSISTENT! Part of the fun of hacking is the THRILL of the hunt!</p> <p></p> <p>As someone that has breached a lot of systems, It’s fun spending hours and hours, even weeks if need be to breach a system. Hackers love a challenge and love testing the capabilities of their intellectual capacity!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">They Understand Hacking is a SCIENCE! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>MANY folks don’t understand this… BUT HACKING IS A SCIENCE!</p> <p></p> <p>For example, the typical ping command, wouldn’t even think you could get much out of it right? WRONG! ICMP data packets return a value that is known as a TTL, which is the number of hops a data packet can take before it’s dropped! HOWEVER, under the hood, the return value for it is also another means to spot which OS archetype the end user is running which is a form of OS fingerprinting!. If you see a TTL value of 64, even without nmap, you can tell it’s running linux! This is useful on a fundamental level since A LOT of security systems block probes that come from nmap. You’d have to use your overall smarts and formulate a hypothesis based on that information such as: what are the most commonly used Linux OS’s(debian ubuntu for example). From there you can blindly probe and test exploits to see if any of them click. See how “ingenious” and 1000 IQ I got with that analogy? THIS IS HACKING!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">They Understand Social Engineering 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Social engineering is one of, if not, one of THE main skills EVERY hacker should know. It’s commonly used and when it connects… the damage that can be done…. DEVASTATING!</p> <p></p> <p>Being able to understand how your opponent thinks allows you to know their every move, which in return, allows you to craft a beautiful exploit. You can know what someone else will do before they even do it!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up!

This is a BIG deal seeing as their reputation is on the line and they crippled 8.5 million systems around the globe, some of which were medical systems which is a BIG deal!</p> <p></p> <p>In other words, to better summarize this, they basically said “Nah bro it’s YOUR fault your systems went down!”</p> <p></p> <p>I spoke about the matter before and discussed why it’s actually considered a security incident, one of the biggest we’ve ever had, many of which thought the complete opposite.</p> <p></p> <p>I also dived into a sensitive topic regarding cloud based security and the overall dangers of it. If you would like to hear more about it, including a lot of my original points surrounding the CrowdStrike incident, check out this post here where I give my full insights on the matter.</p> <p></p> <p>The goal of today’s article is to discuss an important matter on WHEN it’s the end users fault or the vendor/providers fault during a security incident/breach. This is a HIGHLY debated matter that’s usually skewed all across the board!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Is it Delta’s Fault? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>NO! It is NOT their fault it took them so long to recover. Don’t let the gaslighting fool you, it’s CrowdStrikes fault!</p> <p></p> <p>Be mindful, the CrowdStrike incident CRASHED systems, and when I mean CRASH, I mean BLUE SCREEN of death crash, meaning the entire system was NON functional and needed a hard reboot! Every system that had incorporated their software was essentially taken off the map!</p> <p></p> <p>Crowdstrikes counter argument to them was partially because Delta Air Lines admitted to turning off automatic updates from them which they consider to be “lack of Cyber Security knowledge” on their end, which IS NOT bad Cyber Security practice! It’s good to do manual updates as you can filter out any bad updates should they occur! HOWEVER, be mindful, they did not refuse to apply major security updates where needed, so that argument from CrowdStike is a slap in the face to one of their victims!</p> <p></p> <p>Also, even with them turning auto updates off, they were STILL impacted during the major security incident! I want you to let that sink in a bit!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">When is it the End Users Fault? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Ever have stuff like MFA and various other security upgrades from apps shoved in your face? Ever had it forced on you otherwise you LITERALLY can’t use the app? It probably felt like a cold call from a salesman and you probably opted out of it just so you can go on with your day.</p> <p></p> <p>THAT my friend is WHEN it’s the end users fault!</p> <p></p> <p>It’s only the end users fault when they CHOOSE to NOT apply the security you set in place! CrowdStrike on the other hand, EVERYONE relied on it and CHOOSE to apply their security into their systems!</p> <p></p> <p>Another example of when it would be the end user's fault, is a penetration tester telling them what’s wrong with their systems and they CHOOSE to accept the risk rather than mitigate it!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">When is it the Vendors Fault? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>It’s only the vendor/providers fault when they FAIL to maintain the security for their systems set in place to protect end users.</p> <p></p> <p>A good example of this would of course be none other than CrowdStrike themselves, where EVERYONE applied the security but CrowdStrike FAILED to MAINTAIN the security!</p> <p></p> <p>Be mindful, CrowdStrike provides cloud based SECURITY to people…. so…. if they FAIL to maintain it… EVERYONE that relied on their service faced not only a security outage, but some… A SECURITY BREACH!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What Should CrowdStrike Do? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>COMPENSATE THEM OF COURSE!</p> <p></p> <p>It’s sad when the best of the best stoop so low and avoid accountability!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up!

This leads to you having to backtrack and find the EXACT resource you came across in order to solve a problem you’ve encountered before, OR, simply needing to recall a bit of information for trivia reasons if need be. This could cost you HOURS of time.</p> <p></p> <p>By documenting all your findings and research, should you ever run into this type of situation, you’ll have more quick access and be able to easily grep what you need. As long as you ORGANIZE everything, you’ll have no trouble finding what you need.</p> <p></p> <p>I’ve been documenting all my research and findings for over 12 YEARS in tech: videos, links, html pages of exact sources that have been redacted, EVERYTHING! I write my own research material and quick guides so in the event I don’t remember something accurately or I need to recall a technique, I can pull it up no worries, saving me the trouble of having to remember everything and dig for it again. In other words, I HAVE CHEAT SHEETS ON DECK!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">It Helps you Solve Problems 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Going back to that thing I mentioned before, it being able to help you with solving problems. YES, DOCUMENTING YOUR JOURNEY… DOES… HELP… YOU… SOLVE… PROBLEMS!!!!</p> <p></p> <p>Many times I’ve been in situations where I KNEW how to solve something, but FORGOT</p> <p></p> <p>HOW to solve it, specifically the thing I did in the past that worked. Usually for me the answer is ALWAYS on the tip of my tongue, OR, I’ll know the name of it along with partial information.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, when I was working on my Crypto Malware exploit, I FORGOT all about the Queue module but KNEW it was the KEY to helping me create the exploit! Because I documented my past code snippets on it, and it it was neatly organized, I was able to pull it up and borrow what I needed for it, further dissecting it, in order to craft the exploit, which I cut into a demo for people to learn from</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">You Pick Up Soft Skills 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>When you document your journey, oftentimes you’ll be FORCED to break it all down and simplify it so that you, the creator, is able to interpret/reinterpret said information when need be.</p> <p></p> <p>This is a GOOD habit to get into, as it allows you to get GOOD at explaining how well you understand the various tech and techniques you learn in Cyber.</p> <p></p> <p>Part of being a GOOD Cyber Security professional is being able to have solid soft skills. It allows you to better explain what you know to people that might not be all too technical, which could aid you in many areas: leadership roles should you pursue it, interviews with tech leads that want to see what you know, even content should you be interested in creating your own.</p> <p></p> <p>Part of the main reason why I’m so good at teaching complex topics in Cyber as well as breaking it down for you is due to me developing my soft skills.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up!

Programming isn’t as scary as people make it out to be.</p> <p></p> <p>To encourage you more, I’ll even address a sensitive topic on whether or not you need to be GOOD at MATH in order to code, a topic which most people that DON’T know how to code speak on a lot.</p> <p></p> <p>Be mindful, in terms of programming in general, THERE is no predefined order on which you learn first. It depends on the path you choose for what you intend to do. In my case I am speaking on HACKING/CYBER, NOT Software Engineering altogether!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Learn Python FIRST 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>It’s a no brainer…. but LEARN PYTHON FIRST! It’s a beginner friendly programming language that’s easy to learn and pick up, AND, you can do A LOT of crazy stuff with it!</p> <p></p> <p>You’ve seen my exploits and tools right? Nearly ALL of them are written in Python!</p> <p></p> <p>A LOT of people sh*t on python, but you know what they say, "ThEy HaTe Me CaUsE tHeY aIn'T mE 🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴"</p> <p></p> <p>Python is a multi-tool language that can do a variety of things: electrical engineering, GUI development, web development, machine learning, even low level stuff which it’s not designed to do.</p> <p></p> <p>It receives a TON of support, so much that you often question “what can’t python do?” It doesn't outdo EVERY programming language, BUT, it does do a bit of everything which is what makes it a hackers best friend.</p> <p></p> <p>Python is also a language that writes LESS and does MORE, which is one of the MAIN reasons it’s a hackers BEST FRIEND! A lot of my tools that I wrote would simply take TOO long to write in another language, whereas with Python, because it has such efficient and well written modules and frameworks for it, I can do something as simple as creating a backdoor in less than 20 lines of code.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Learn C++ 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I know MANY will disagree with me on this, but pick up C++. It REWARDS you MEGA hard in the long run, allowing you to pick up MANY programming languages and native fundamentals, as well as the native language it stems from which all syntax is based on which is C. You’ll be a coding monster in no time and will be able to speed blitz learning languages left and right!</p> <p></p> <p>“But Futaba C++ IS TOO HARD!”</p> <p></p> <p>NO, it’s not! MANY are just BAD teachers! You’d be surprised how simple the language is to learn if people just EXPLAINED it to you properly!</p> <p></p> <p>C++ gets a bad rep for being a HARD language due to OOP(Object Oriented Programming), which honestly isn’t hard either.</p> <p></p> <p>C++ allows you to do a lot of low level stuff, on top of allowing you to dive more into malware analysis and reverse engineering. You can also do robotics with it!</p> <p></p> <p>If you manage to get past the learning curve you’ll be unstoppable in the long run.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Is Math Required? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>drumroll plays</p> <p>NO! YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNOW HIGH LEVEL MATH IN ORDER TO CODE!!</p> <p></p> <p>Schools that lie to students dropping their drinks after me saying all of this</p> <p></p> <p>“HE’S A MENACE!!!!!!!”</p> <p></p> <p>YES ladies and gentlemen, people are LYING to you when they say you NEED to know advanced mathematics! I’ve been programming for over 12 years and not once have I ever needed advanced: algebra, geometry, calculus, etc in order to code. All you need to do is understand how programming works as a science and how to apply it in the real world. All the math is done for you. The most you’ll need is BASIC arithmetic!</p> <p></p> <p>There’s a reason why we have stuff like frameworks and SDKs(Software Developer Kits). It’s to make it easier for people to code, preventing you from having to build all of that stuff all over again.</p> <p></p> <p>The only time you’ll need high level mathematics is if you’re building your own encryption cipher from scratch, OR, if you happen to be doing anything that REQUIRES Math!</p> <p></p> <p>Colleges and Universities: “BUT THE CURRICULUM!!!!</p> <p></p> <p>SCREW THE CURRICULUM!

THEY DO NOT GUARANTEE YOU A JOB!</p> <p></p> <p>Most training programs like bootcamps and universities/colleges for example, sell on the fact they “guarantee you a job”, hence the testimonies they usually have in order to convince you to join their program.</p> <p></p> <p>The problem with most programs today, and why many are skeptical of them, reasonably so, is because they take your money and overall waste your time as most people have admitted they didn't’ land a role after completing said program.</p> <p></p> <p>Personally for me I’m ok with a training program NOT doing that. Just be upfront about it. Mine will be like that which I’ve made CRYSTAL CLEAR from the beginning!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Fix Part 2 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Training programs should be required to give sample courses/instruction that allow you to try their product BEFORE you buy into it! And by required, I mean as a LEGAL form of practice where there are rules and guidelines to follow should you operate said program.</p> <p></p> <p>At the very least, if it’s not something that can be legally done, it should be ethically done, where one should also follow in suit and NOT join anything that hasn’t given sampled course work to them.</p> <p></p> <p>A lot of programs are crafty and will expect up front payment first without ever giving you a taste of the product.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Do We Need them? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Combine recruitment agencies with training programs.</p> <p></p> <p>Has anyone ever thought of I dunno… having training programs that link you with recruitment that HIRES you?</p> <p></p> <p>Not only will this boost credibility for those looking to start genuine programs, but it’ll also allow people to jump right into the field should they graduate successfully from the program, GUARANTEEING them a job.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How To Pick one? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Like I’ve mentioned, make sure they give out FREE samples! If they refuse to do so, simply don’t invest in it.</p> <p></p> <p>Also, look for SOLID reviews on the program. If the odds are you can’t find any, OR, there aren’t any negative ones PERIOD, then that might be an indicator of a red flag for you.</p> <p></p> <p>Overall look for free stuff first and see your options BEFORE you buy!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it.

It’s also an easter egg that “probes” that part of your mind, making you more curious about my content. It’s also quirky and stands out a lot.</p> <p></p> <p>I also tend to drop a lot of easter eggs and references which also resonate with people since they LOVE finding their FAVORITE things that way.</p> <p></p> <p>My overall vibe? To make Hacking/Cyber Security GAMIFIED and MORE FUN! Tech can be boring, this coming from a tech nerd overall haha. The way I present the content to you, serving it this way, allows you to REMEMBER and RETAIN what you learn from my content, which is something most people DON’T do which I take advantage of!</p> <p></p> <p>One last theme for my content before I move on, is being as INSIGHTFUL as possible! My goal is to SHOW you how to think outside the box and inspire you to be creative with your thinking, which you NEED to survive in Cyber!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Build a Website 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A LOT OF PEOPLE neglect this, but creating a site of some sorts allows you to deliver your content in a more engaging manner.</p> <p></p> <p>Take my site for example. The vibrant colors, cards, and hover effects, even terminal mode, create an experience that leaves an impression on you and makes you want to click on stuff.</p> <p></p> <p>When building one, however you choose to do so, MAKE IT ORIGINAL, which is going to lead into my next point.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">BE ORIGINAL! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A LOT of people when they’re getting into content creation drop the ball by DOING THE SAME THING! That’s no good! You NEED to do BETTER! Evolve the standard formula and do something original with it!</p> <p></p> <p>Be authentic and unique! Having a personality matters, and will greatly attract people (if it’s good of course).</p> <p></p> <p>If you pay close attention to how I do things and run my brand, you’ll notice people are drawn to how authentic and quirky I am. It’s REFRESHING and strays from the same thing we’ve seen OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Find Inspiration! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the most common struggles with people that are looking to get into content creation is they have issues finding inspiration to CONSISTENTLY make content! I’ve struggled with this as well which is why I needed to take a break for a bit! I was running out of steam since I’ve already pumped out so much stuff.</p> <p></p> <p>Browse around other content creators and find stuff to talk about that is similar to the type of content you make! You can piggyback and talk about it, engaging with the OP, which further allows you to collab and work with other fellow content creators.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">COLLAB 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the most common struggles with people that are looking to get into content creation is they have issues finding inspiration to CONSISTENTLY make content! I’ve struggled with this as well which is why I needed to take a break for a bit! I was running out of steam since I’ve already pumped out so much stuff.</p> <p></p> <p>Browse around other content creators and find stuff to talk about that is similar to the type of content you make! You can piggyback and talk about it, engaging with the OP, which further allows you to collab and work with other fellow contenaFind content creators that you can vibe with and see if you can work together. This of course isn’t a problem unless you’ve been ahem… glares at you NETWORKING!</p> <p></p> <p>I’M LOOKING AT YOU INTROVERTS INCLUDING MYSELF!!</p> <p></p> <p>Collabing is important as it allows you to connect with others and further build reputational value WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING that sets you up in the long run.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up!

I am a hacker after all haha. Let me give my thoughts on this new “AI” model.</p> <p></p> <p>You'll learn a lot of key stuff that could help you on your Cyber Security journey!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">It’s a THREAT 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>For starters, this thing is an overall threat in my opinion to be honest from a security standpoint.</p> <p></p> <p>Much like how hackers were able to exploit ChatGPT prompts to poison it, the same can be done for it, EXCEPT, ON A MORE DEEPER level if you get crafty enough with it. You can even mesh it with stuff like Windows Recall and other techniques to do some real damage with it if you wanted to!</p> <p></p> <p>“BUT FUTABA! IT’S ONLY IN BETA! THEY HAVE TIME TO FIX-”</p> <p></p> <p>OK! Yeah, So did ChatGPT and it’s other variants, but like ALWAYS, security is almost NEVER in mind for projects like this!</p> <p></p> <p>It’s more prone to security breaches than an actual person and further subject to compromise since it is unable to apply basic operational training procedures in a flexible manner to prevent exploits from connecting.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">It’s Rubber Ducky 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>However grins menacingly</p> <p></p> <p>It's also a rubber ducky that you can now seamlessly make and train for exploits since you can pool all the data from the API and seamlessly tailor it to whatever you need it to do. As someone that WRITES rubber duckies, this thing is a life saver haha. With the API you can even combine some analog stuff with it to give it a boost and have it do whatever you want.</p> <p></p> <p>It's even more scary since it could have access to higher levels of privileges you can easily exploit with it should you breach a system running this thing.</p> <p></p> <p></p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Do We NEED This? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Tbh I don't see people really asking for this product. Seems like they're just trying to hop on the new bandwagon for AI products which is the new trend nowadays. It's not even AI tbh and is just a scripted engine that might require human interaction in the long run, making it non-autonomous which defeats the purpose of it being an AI.</p> <p></p> <p>This product, although it sounds nice on paper, has a major flaw in that it might not even be compatible and able to autonomously control various applications that exist in an infrastructure.</p> <p></p> <p>Much like with actual keyboard injection, it has to factor various versions and builds of OS and applications as well as the various infinite scenarios that exist while controlling the system. It's simply not possible to do all of that which will again defeat the purpose of it being an AI system since it will require you to know how to program said scenarios for how you intend to use it.</p> <p></p> <p>If they REALLY wanted to train it, they'd have to</p> <p></p> <p>FBI: “Go on I'm listening Tell me more 👀👀👀!”</p> <p></p> <p>AHEM.. as I was saying!</p> <p></p> <p>If they REALLY wanted to collect enough data in order to truly optimize this thing properly, they'd have to start collecting data on people's keystrokes and how they'd control the system which I DOUBT most people would be too comfortable with.</p> <p></p> <p>But hey, that's just a THEORY! A GAME THEORY- trap door opens before I can finish my line</p> <p></p> <p>Overall, I think they overall need to go back to the drawing board with this one.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up!

I’ll also dive into a bit why I’m more drawn to helping them and WHY it matters to me so much.</p> <p></p> <p>I’m also going to give you a little history lesson on the major role Women play in tech and the major contributions they’ve made, many of which if it were not for them we wouldn’t have most of the stuff we see in front of us today, including technology that has even improved the lives of people like me with autism and various other forms of disabilities. We have A LOT to thank them for but it doesn’t get celebrated or talked about often except for special occasions like Women’s History month.</p> <p></p> <p>The goal of this post is to inspire women on WHY they belong in tech and WHY they should pursue a career in technology.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">They ARE the ORIGIN 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I’ve talked about this before… but WOMEN ARE THE TRUE FOUNDERS for anything related to computing technology.</p> <p></p> <p>Stuff like: The first human readable programming language such as COBOL which made programming more accessible to everyone, WI-FI which we all use today, Bluetooth, even the source code for the Apollo space project which brought us to the moon for the first time, were all created by women, most of which were NEVER properly credited to them. Even the first digitization of the “computer”, based on the analytical engine by Ada Lovelace, wouldn’t have been possible without them.</p> <p></p> <p>“But there are videos and history texts and-”</p> <p></p> <p>Yeah, but most of it is thrown under the rug without much coverage! Women were ROBBED of the spotlight they deserved, where the impression was given that MEN did it first.</p> <p></p> <p>They were known as “Refrigerator Ladies” where they were never really given credit for all the hard work they did.</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">We Need More Women In Tech? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Ever seen a product so "unique" that you just knew you had to be apart of it!? This is where being authentic comes into play!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Personal brands are just that, PERSONAL! It's a reflection of your overall uniqueness and personal traits.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>WHY is this important? Here's a little analogy that I think you'll understand. Ever picked up a piece of "music" and you "felt" like it "spoke out to you"? Being authentic allows you to connect with others who share the same perspective as you!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>For example, part of my brand is a whole "gamified" Cyber Security vibe! This allows me to connect with folks in the Cyber realm, A LOT of which recognize a lot of the iconic themes and references I drop all the time. This allows me to build a relationship and network with them, establishing what is known as "reputational" value that plays a big factor into whether they wish to support my content!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Even the way I write my articles is authentic, in that I'm very "insightful", dinging the light bulb in folks head that gets them thinking!</p> </br></br> <h4 style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">The Purpose Of My Brand? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>I don't really talk about this much, mostly because I don’t like making promises I can’t deliver on, but one of the main focuses for my brand in the long run will be to partner and get sponsored by places like WiCyS that help women pursue careers in Cybersecurity and technology. Part of my program, the main reason it’s taking a bit to polish it is because there WILL be a section for WOMEN in it where they get a lot more attention to make sure they’re fit to pursue whichever path in Cyber they see fit.</p> <p></p> <p>I also want to show up to more conferences and teach them. It’s fun!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>If you enjoyed this post give it a thumbs up! I’ll be keeping track of whose reacting from now on as there is a “special” reason for it.
